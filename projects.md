Here is a list of basically every project I've taken the time to document somewhat on this site. Includes personal projects, collaborative efforts and uni work. 

# Ongoing

## Magewinds

A tabletop miniature skirmish wargame in which everyone is a wizard. You can check it out and get all the rules on the game's [official website](http://www.magewinds.com/).

# Abandoned

## Games

### Quiver

Quiver is a cross-platform pseudo-3d game engine I'm writing in my spare time in C++. It grew out of the Box2D raycasting experiment I wrote about [here]({% post_url 2016/2016-04-07-box2d-raycasting-test %}) and [here]({% post_url 2016/2016-04-27-box2d-raycasting-progress %}) and has become quite a fruitful learning project. You can check out the source code at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rachelnertia/Quiver).

### Water (2014)

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz3jgA7NtzI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- DirectX 11, C++
- Part 1 of my Graphics Programming with Shaders coursework ([Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ug39wrjzturemor/graphics%20programming%20with%20shaders.zip?dl=0))
- Water plane is tessellated. Waves formed by manipulating vertices in the domain shader. Normal map used to add some noisiness to the surface.
- Water reflects the skybox cubemap
- Bonus: full-screen pixelation effect (the easiest full-screen effect to write!)
