These guys are from [Soul Strike](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Age-Of-Sigmar-Storm-Strike-2018-eng), but they are also available in [a paint set](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Scast-Paint-Set-Eng-spa-port-latv-rom-2018), [Champions of Dreadfane](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/WHU-Champions-Of-Dreadfane-EN-2019), individually in Warhammer shops for painting lessons, and now in the first issue of the [Mortal Realms part-works magazine](https://www.warhammermortalrealms.com/). So it's safe to conclude Games Workshop made a *lot* of them.

Tried a slightly simpler recipe for the green this time. Previously I would:

1. Basecoat Waagh Flesh
2. Recess shade with Drakenhof Nightshade
3. Tidy up any tidemarks with more Waagh Flesh
4. Highlight Warboss Green
5. Highlight Skarsnik Green
6. Highlight Skarsnik Green / Ulthuan Grey
7. Highlight Ulthuan Grey

Now, going forwards, I skip the shading step and instead of basecoating with Waagh Flesh I use the darker, more blueish Caliban Green (an old paint that I need to find a modern equivalent of). This way's a bit quicker and looks almost the same, if not better.

I'm still not satisfied with how I paint the beige tabard-things. They don't quite have enough contrast.

Once again, the most time-consuming part was putting down basecoats, particularly gold. Retributor Armour is a decent enough gold, I suppose, but no gold paint has great coverage. Some other Stormcast models (like Liberators) are mostly armour so I can be more efficient by using Retributor Gold spray, but Sequitors (and Sacrosanct in general) are 50% robes. Something some painters do to help it cover is put a layer of brown underneath. Maybe I'll give that a go, even if, intuitively, it just adds another time-consuming step. 

I have one more Sequitor to go, but he's just a duplicate of the guy with the greatmace. If I paint him up I can field a unit of 10!
