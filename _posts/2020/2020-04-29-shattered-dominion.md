A couple weeks ago I finished painting this lovely little set of [objective markers](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Age-Of-Sigmar-Objective-Markers-2018) from Games Workshop. They're all very extra, absolutely bursting with character. Can't wait to use them in games, even just as bits of scenery.

A little further back I painted up a set of the old Walls and Fences kit from back in the Warhammer Fantasy Battles days. I always thought these pieces were friggin adorable and wanted to paint them up. I was lucky to get these free from a friend! I think I've done them justice.
