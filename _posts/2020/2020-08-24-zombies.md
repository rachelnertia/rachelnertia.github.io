Recently I painted up 9 of Fireforge Games' [Living Dead Peasants](https://fireforge-games.com/living-dead/364-living-dead-peasants.html). Me and a friend went half-and-half a box of these that was being sold cheaply by North Star because the packaging was messed up, or something. All I know is I got to build and paint some very high-quality medieval zombies for a very low price. Here they are:

Building them was totally painless. There were no spindly connections or snappable bits, just good solid plastic that takes plastic glue well. They painted up easily with a quick messy zenithal undercoat followed by some splodges of Contrast paint and a wash of Agrax Earthshade over the tattered clothing.

This is a great wee kit and I'm sure they'll see use in a variety of games. I hope I get to sample some more of Fireforge's offerings in the future. Perhaps some more of their [Living Dead](https://fireforge-games.com/living-dead-48)? Or maybe something from the [Northern Kingdom](https://fireforge-games.com/northern-kingdom-47) range?

(Man, it feels good to be writing a little hobby update again.)
