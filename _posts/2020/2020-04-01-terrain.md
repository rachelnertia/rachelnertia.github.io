I made more terrain. Some of it is just more CD-based scatter pieces like [last time]({% post_url 2020/2020-02-16-grassy-scatter-terrain %}). Other bits are on cardboard and foamboard bases.

The main event is the three hills I made. The bulk of these is extruded polystyrene, cut and sanded into shape, based on a sheet of foamboard, then textured with [Luke's APS sculptamold-alternative](https://www.geekgaming.co.uk/products/lukes-aps-modelling-compound-1-litre). 

I learned a lot from making these. I think my main takeaway with the hills is to be more aware of what makes for a good hill gameplay-wise as I cut them into shape. These ones are okay but not ideal: measurements between figures at the bottom and the top of the slope are a little awkward and the surface is a bit too bumpy. Next time I'll try to make some hills that have steeper slopes (easier to measure) and some that are short and gently-sloped, so they can mostly be ignored for gameplay purposes.
