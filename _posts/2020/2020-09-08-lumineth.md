I have a lot of hobby blogging to catch up on. I'm not going to do it all, but I'll cover some of the big things.

In July, fancying a big treat, I picked up the Lumineth Realm-Lords limited edition launch box. It contained 10 Wardens (spearmen), 5 Dawnriders (cavalry), the Light of Eltharion (a named hero), the battletome and some assorted special tokens and wotsits.

Despite my glowing weak spot for elves of all sorts, I really wasn't sure I liked the Lumineth model range until a particular colour scheme popped into my head and I *needed* to try it out. It took a bit of experimentation, but fortunately it turned out quite well! I'm excited to see how it will look on other models and how I can improve it over time.

I'm really excited to see Lumineth on the tabletop and what they bring to the Age of Sigmar setting. I want to see the other elemental warriors and spirits, the remaining 4 Great Nations, the other kinds of Scinari.

Having said all that, I'm not in a hurry to pick up any new models. They're rather pricey and I have too many other things to buy, build and paint already. I can see myself building up this force slowly over time. In the meantime, I might come back to these models and make a few small adjustments. On inspection, there's some things I missed that I'd like to tidy up.
