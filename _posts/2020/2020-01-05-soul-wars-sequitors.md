I began the year by finishing up my first batch of Sequitors. 

These are from [Soul Wars](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Age-Of-Sigmar-Soul-Wars-2018-eng), the current main Age of Sigmar starter box, which I bought the Stormcast Eternal half of from a friend. There are 8 of them, with 5 different sculpts: 2 different Sequitor-Primes, and 2 each of a guy with mace-and-shield, a lady with mace-and-shield, and a guy with a big mace. These are push-fit mono-pose and mono-build figures, so unless you start chopping them up you can only build them one way. 

8 is a bit of an awkward number because in the game they are supposed to come in multiples of 5, so until I paint a few more (which is exactly what I'm doing next) I can only field one unit of 5 instead of 2 units of 5 or a big unit of 10. I'm not sure when I'll get them on the table anyway.

There are some things about them I could have done better. 

The green cloth looks great but my method for painting them doesn't scale well to batch-painting, so I ended up being a little messier with them than I would have liked. I should figure out a more efficient way to paint these that looks similar. 

The gold lacks contrast, a problem I've noted about a lot my Stormcast. I need to investigate ways to make it richer, shinier, etc.

On the beige cloth I was experimenting a little, so these look a bit inconsistent across the unit. I did find a simple way to do them that I'm pleased with, though, so I'll be using that method going forward. The beige is still a little too similar to the yellow-white of the parchment some of them have. 

I'm quite happy with the red bits but I'd like to find a way to make them punchier and do them faster.

The early stages of painting these models, just getting the base coats down, was a slog. They have so much extra detail and different materials compared to Liberators or Judicators. I'm looking forward to painting the remaining 4 I have to do, a more manageable batch.
