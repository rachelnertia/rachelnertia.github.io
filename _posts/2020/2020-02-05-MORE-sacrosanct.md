3 more Stormcast on the Stormcast pile! These are the Castigators from [Storm Strike](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Age-Of-Sigmar-Storm-Strike-2018-eng).

I adore these models. Turns out they actually come in units of 3 after all, so this is a minimum-size unit. If I get a couple more I can run a unit of 9. I'm sure I'll get at least 6 of them on the table at some point, just to see if they can do any work.

This was my first proper project using Vallejo Metal Colors paints. I was trying to match the look of my usual Retributor Armour recipe. The end result is a little less yellow, but plenty shiny and rich, and it took less than half the time to do. Going forward I think I'll be doing as much as possible using Metal Colors - they really are amazing.

Also in the box you get a lovely little bird-dog companion!

I want more gryph-hounds to go with her!

In the background you can see my new Army Painter wet palette. I've been using a homebrew tupperware-and-baking-paper solution since I started in the hobby 2 years or so ago and after Christmas I felt like spending some money and making the leap to a "proper" wet palette. I feel like a bit of a mark every time I notice the Army Painter logo on the case, but otherwise I am very pleased with my purchase - the special paper and foam perform much better than anything I could have homebrewed.

Finally, I have painted the Knight-Incantor from Soul Wars. I'm not super pleased with her face but I did my best. Apart from that I think she looks great.

With that, I've finished all the Stormcast from Soul Wars and Storm Strike. Looking forward to running a mostly-Sacrosanct army sometime soon.

I still have that one remaining Sequitor to paint who I got for free in the Warhammer shop on the Royal Mile, but I think I'll chip away at him as I proceed with other projects. I am done with painting Stormcast Eternals for the moment.
