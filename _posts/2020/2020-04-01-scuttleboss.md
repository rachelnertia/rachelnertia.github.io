GoblinWatch 2020 continues with a small goblin on a big spider.

I'm not a big fan of the model, to be honest, and I kinda rushed to get it done. I hope they do a new version of it someday, like they did with the Loonboss on Giant Squig. In fact I hope they revamp the whole Spiderfang side of the Gloomspite Gitz range, I love spiders and want more of them.

Despite not really digging the model I'm looking forward to playing with him, either when The Ongoing Situation comes to an end or I crack and start trying to play Warhammer alone.
