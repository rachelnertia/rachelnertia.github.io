I've never painted squigs before, so this is somewhat of a milestone. I think they came out really well.

You can run these in units of 5 (plus a herder) or multiples of 5. I think when I paint more squigs, or if I come back to these, I'll do something to make half of them a bit distinct from the others. I'd like each group of 5 to look a little bit different. Not wildly so; just some variation in patterns, highlight tones, whatever. 

Here are the handlers!

I friggin love them, gang. Kinda bummed I couldn't build the alternate versions of them where the musician is holding a pair of cymbals and the prodder has a mushroom-on-a-stick instead. I guess that means I have an excuse to acquire a second box, or perhaps pick up the new [Start Collecting](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2020/03/01/sunday-preview-star-lizards-and-start-collecting-boxes/)?

What's next? Well, I was going to paint [Hrothgorn's Mantrappers](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/WHU-Hrothgorns-Mantrappers-EN-2020) because I want to start playing them in Underworlds. Then the local Age of Sigmar escalation league started up and gave me a big incentive to crack on with my Gloomspite Gitz. All my hobby plans were thrown into disarray, but now they've coalesced again and I have a detailed plan for how I'm going to get the Gitz done. So that's what the next couple/few months will be filled with: more goblins, spiders, and squigs.
