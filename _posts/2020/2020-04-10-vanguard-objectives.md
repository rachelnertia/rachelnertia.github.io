Recently I painted up the [Battlefield Objectives](https://www.manticgames.com/games/vanguard/battlefield-objectives/) set from Mantic's [Kings of War: Vanguard](https://www.manticgames.com/games/vanguard/) range. I think these are the first Mantic minis I've painted.

There's a stash of food and drink, a cannonball pile, an abandoned satchel, a box of blades, a treasure chest, a dragon egg, a dead horse-rider... and the cringe-worthy damsel-in-distress. (Perhaps I'll create a story for her in which she goes on a rampage once free.)

My favourite parts are these nice standing stones, perfect for any battlefield:

There's also a beacon...

... with detachable fire!

Lots of fun to paint, of course. Washes, drybrushing, all easy. Looking forward to painting more Mantic models.
