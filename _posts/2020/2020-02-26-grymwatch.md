I am not ashamed to say these were a rush job. The painting time was quick - I estimate about 5 hours - and consisted of little more than a zenithal basecoat followed by a few splashes of Citadel Contrast paint.

Despite the low time investment, I'm really pleased with the results. There's lots of contrast between colours, light and shadow. The colour scheme is unusual without being garish or too unnatural, and all the details are crisp and clean. Most importantly, the recipe is easily scalable for when I get around to painting more Flesh-Eater Courts models.

Here's the whole gang:
