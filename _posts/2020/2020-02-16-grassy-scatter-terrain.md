I made these by roughly following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqmYWesal9w) by Terrain Tutor. Instead of spackle I used [modelling compound](https://www.geekgaming.co.uk/products/lukes-aps-modelling-compound-1-litre) and instead of slate I used bits of foam for the rocks. The trees are from Woodland Scenics, and while they're a bit diminuitive, they're not so small that they look entirely out of place next to 28mm-scale minis.

This was a great way to start making terrain and I gained a lot of confidence. I'll make a few more, with bases of different sizes and shapes, to scatter about the battlefield.
