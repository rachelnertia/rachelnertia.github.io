*Finally* got these done. This squad of 5 is from Soul Wars.

I adore these models. Excellent crossbow grenade launcher things. The Prime's pose is cool but I'm not sure why she is wearing such generous high heels.

Like a lot of Stormcast units, they have somewhat questionable rules. You'd expect grenade launchers to have a bit more punch to them, but without increasing the unit size and buffing them up a bit (there's a few ways) their output looks marginal. That said, they are only 80 points, which I think makes them the cheapest Stormcast. I don't know. Also I haven't put them on the table yet. Maybe they're useful in their own special way.

Up next: 3 more Castigators, the ones from Soul Strike. I'd like to be able to field a unit of 10, but I'll need to find a way to get another 3 non-Primes from somewhere to do that. 

### Secret Bonus Content!

I am lucky to be part of a truly excellent online hobby community. For the 2nd year in a row an outstanding member of said community arranged a Secret Santa gift exchange in which people make special conversions and all kinds of cute stuff to send to their Santa-ee. I received some adorable Ghyran-themed objective markers along with a short story about them. I love them!

(I added a bit of green flock to them today. Perhaps it's a bit sacrilegious to modify a gift someone made for you.)

As for which delightful community member made these for me, I do not know. The game is afoot!
