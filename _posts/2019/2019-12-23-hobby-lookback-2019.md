Oh, but I did paint a lot this year. 2019 prove me wrong about the extent to which hobby could take over my life and, coming to the end of it, I regret not having managed to do *more*. How is this possible? I should have blogged about it as I went, but I didn't because apparently blogging is too much effort for me now? Fortunately I mostly did a decent job of documenting my progress on Twitter and on my portal-to-hell [personal Trello board](https://trello.com/b/uXGR1auS/hobby). So this post will mostly consist of links to those, otherwise it would have about 50 photos in it.

I began the year by working on some of North Star's recent additions to their Frostgrave range, like this [Barbarian](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1091121383319449600), [Templar](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1091121560356864001), [Apothecary](https://trello.com/c/yFer2qLc/123-frostgrave-apothecary-ii) and [others](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1084490341275877376).

I also made a [boar](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1091121301320810496)! This lil' guy is a spare who comes with the old Orc Chariot kit. There are two more piggies I could make out of that old kit, but they require a bit more work (their lower jaw pieces are attached to the chariot).

I based some old Warhammer models. I painted these in 2018, I think, but didn't base them. They look great with decorated bases, each brimming with their own character. There are [bats](https://trello.com/c/RHSY123I/135-oldhammer-bats-basing) and [snotlings](https://trello.com/c/x4T9ZXeB/134-oldhammer-snotlings-goblins-basing). These were some of the first models I ever acquired, and it fills me with satisfaction every time I see them in their current well-painted, well-based state. I think I will make some Warcry rules for them.

February/March/stretching into April was goblin season. When Natalie's parents discovered I was getting into the hobby, they were more than happy to foist her and her brother's old collections upon me. This inundation of old, mostly-unpainted models included all the models from a copy of Battle for Skull Pass, the starter box for Warhammer Fantasy Battles 7th Edition. The Dwarf side of that box is still waiting for my attention, but I managed to paint my way through the whole Night Goblin half. This included:

- 40 spear-wielding gobbos and 20 bow-wielding gobbos. [The biggest bunch of models I ever done](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1104156973753344000).
- A boss goblin with a pet squig
- A shaman with a cauldron of mushrooms
- 10 [Spider Riders](https://trello.com/c/30xhkcxx/52-aos-grot-spider-riders-battle-for-skull-pass)
- A [troll](https://trello.com/c/splzGydq/21-aos-troll-battle-for-skull-pass). Sadly for this guy, there's no analogous model in AoS for him anymore since Sourbreath Troggoths were discontinued.
- Some small scenery pieces.

With these came a couple of metal goblin shamans. Lovely sculpts, painted them up later in the year after the goblinmania had passed. Here's [one of them](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1155511331363131394).

Late March: I painted the [Chosen Axes](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1111947712847638528) from Shadespire. 

Needed some more Skinks as allies for my Stormcast Eternal army, so I did [5 of 'em](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1113478041810944000). I know how to paint these in my simple scheme very quickly. Personally, I think these models hold up a lot better than most of the Seraphon/Lizardmen range, and I hope they keep this kit when they do a refresh. (Saurus Warriors, on the other hand, could desperately do with a new kit in my opinion!)

April/May: With a Â£40 gift voucher to spend, and needing some more terrain for games of Frostgrave, I picked up the [3-box of Osgiliath Ruins](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Osgiliath-Ruins-Box-3-Set) and bashed them out, unlocking a newfound love of terrain painting. It's so fast and simple!

May: [Magore's Fiends](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1125476230755696640), [Spiteclaw's Swarm](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1127990313153454081), [Thorns of the Briar Queen](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1129867108513394688).

May: [Oldhammer Chaos Warrior](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1129891190495764480). This guy was encased in about a centimetre of enamel paint, and it took a lot of time to strip it off him. [Dark Elf Sorceress](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1133108222225780739), acquired from a friend's clearout. I think this model came free with a White Dwarf? [Dark Elf Assassin](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1135660906040504322), acquired from same friend. Probably contains lead, it's that old.

June: [Stormsire's Cursebreakers](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1139662358844968961). [Judicators, and an Angharad](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1144119534368055296) I rescued by giving her a head and a shield, who I am very proud of. 

July: Khorne. I painted the whole of the [Khorne half](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1152986125964914688) of the OG AoS starter box. Contrast did a lot of heavy lifting here, letting me do the skin, the vibrant red and the bone-coloured trim on all of the mooks super quickly. Here is the [Lord](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1152863476341231617).

July: More Judicators, this time with [big fat crossbows](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1155400548444790784).

August, September, onwards: Warcry. The big box. Excellent game. Excellent big box. The [terrain](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1159560161834541057). Took until November to finish painting all the remaining Iron Golems, but here's [the whole gang](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1191087882452295682). [Furies](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1165707031380201472), more [Furies](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1170064874405289984) and [chickens](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1165330960927330304). [Untamed Beasts](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1177475966488104961) in September. 

October: Beastgrave! [Grashrak's Despoilers](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1180887338618105856).

October: Corpsewrack Mausoleum. Spooky!

November: [Skaeth's Wild Hunt](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1195829647214366721) from Beastgrave.

November: [Eowyn](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1196174985666220033) plus some [Warriors of Rohan](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1198020531284512771).

July-December: Lord-Arcanum on Gryph-Charger. This model took ages because I started it and then left it unfinished for months. Don't do this!

December: [Celestar Ballista](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1203095171447037952), [Evocators](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1207443772080054272).

[Built some zombies](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1205926826071203840) from Fireforge games. I'll paint these eventually. Good for when I finally get around to Rangers of Shadow Deep, or something else requiring zombie villagers. 

I spent the last couple of days sprucing up some MDF buildings I inherited when my Frostgrave-playing friend moved away. It looks much nicer now, although I feel like it could still do with a bit more attention. They're excellent kits, but I don't know if I'll get more MDF stuff in the future unless I have a clear idea of how to make it look less flat, thin and textureless. Mind you, [TTCombat's new Savage Domain](https://ttcombat.com/collections/fantasy-realms/savage-domain_all) kits look really nice...

And that wraps things up for 2019. Phew! I am extremely proud of how much I've painted and how much I've improved, tried new things and honed in on how to paint better and faster.

In 2020, I will try to document my progress on here, because in 2020: **I'm going to clear my backlog**.
