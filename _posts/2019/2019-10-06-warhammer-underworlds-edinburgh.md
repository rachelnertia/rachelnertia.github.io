I [noted]({% post_url 2017/2017-12-31-2017-in-gaming %}) back at the end of 2017 that one of my favourite tabletop games I'd played that year was *Warhammer Underworlds: Shadespire*. That was the first edition, or season of content, or whatever you want to call it, of *Warhammer Underworlds*, and since then we've been through 2018's *Nightvault* and now here we are with season/edition 3: *Beastgrave*.

I've been playing the game fairly regularly since 2017 and mostly loving it - I think it's a very robust system which persistently provides players with perplexing puzzles to parse. While I have some reservations about how certain powerful cards have affected the game (mostly solved by the [rotation](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2019/09/08/warhammer-underworlds-the-future-of-competitive-playgw-homepage-post-1/) introduced with *Beastgrave*), my main complaint has really been simply not having enough people to play with. To address this I've helped to set up [Warhammer Underworlds: Edinburgh](https://www.facebook.com/groups/WarhammerUnderworldsEdinburgh).

Our goals:

1) Weekly meetups.
2) Regular tournaments.
3) Ladder league that resets quarterly.
4) Inclusive and lovely. Towards all kinds of play and all kinds of players.
5) To raise awareness about the game and teach it to people who're curious about it.

At the moments our weekly meetup is on Tuesday evenings in [Edinburgh Games Hub](https://www.facebook.com/GamesHubEdinburgh/) on Lauriston Place. I have a few reservations about this arrangement (Tuesday night is super busy at Games Hub and tbh Games Hub is a little shabby!) but it worked pretty well last Tuesday so we'll stick with it for now at least. 

The next thing is to organise a tournament. This'll probably be in late November at [Red Dice Games](https://www.facebook.com/reddicegames) in Leith. (Trying to spread the love a bit.)

Anyway. I've never organised anything like this before, but I'm mostly following the advice and examples of other gaming communities that I've observed both locally and from across the internet. Hopefully it'll go well and if I do screw up a bit it won't be too bad! 

If you wanna learn *Underworlds* then get in touch with me or come along to the weekly meetup on Tuesday at Games Hub, I am more than happy to provide a demo game or two.
