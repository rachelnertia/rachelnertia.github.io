Last year I went hard into miniatures; the hobby grabbed me and just would not let go. I [painted]({% post_url 2019/2019-01-04-hobby-lookback %}) a tonne of stuff! And this year I'm going to try to paint just as much, if not more. Yet, my actual goals for the year aren't to paint X amount of minis or a list of certain things[^1], they're all about gaining confidence with techniques I haven't gotten the handle of.

**My main aspiration** is to get to grips with the process of painting minis by first doing a zenithal highlight, and then using glazes and washes to paint stuff fast. Vince has a good tutorial on this system:

The zenithal highlighting stage consists of painting the model black (or the shadow colour of your choice), then applying a mid-tone grey from about 45 degrees, then the lightest colour (white) from directly above. You can do this with rattlecans, or airbrush, or even by drybrushing. 
See also: [value sketching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0CFC2soR18). I'm confident enough with my airbrush now to use it for this kind of thing. It's glazing that I'm still figuring out.

The idea with glazing is to apply a layer of paint that is so thin as to be partially/mostly transparent[^2]. In the video he uses an airbrush to apply the glaze, but it can be done with a normcore brush. 

**My next goal** is to up my airbrush skills. At the moment I can just about get a miniature primed and zenithal highlighted, but I want to be able to actually get some of the base colours down on larger areas to avoid needing to do painstaking multi-coat brush application.

**Other than that**, I'd like to be able to [wet blend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERX3ghWvMDw), magnetize parts of miniatures for easy weapon-swapping[^3], and take better photos of my minis. And spread my disease around by trying to get more of my friends into the hobby.

What I'm **not** going to do is devote much time to learning how to make terrain, much as it fascinates me. I'll leave that for 2020.

Oh, and, final resolution: *No buying new stuff until I've cleared most of my backlog!*

What are your hobby goals for this year?

[^1]: God knows I have an *enormous* amount of stuff to paint, though.
[^2]: But the paint isn't runny like in a wash. 
[^3]: I did this for a Saurus Knight's arm yesterday! I did a terrible job but now I understand how to do it at least.
