On Saturday I attended [Edinburgh Uni Game Dev Society](http://gamedevsoc.com/)'s ChillJam, a one-day game jam with a relaxed atmosphere. I teamed up with [Norgg](https://twitter.com/norgg) to make a little game about making a cup of tea. 

You can play it [here](https://norgg.itch.io/cuppa).

It's very broken, as you'd expect for something made in about 9 hours, but I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. I really like the idea, too -- I think it would be lovely to someday make a webpage people can visit and simulate making a cup of tea (or some other kind of beverage!), filled with all kinds of nice, rich interactions. A warm, comforting place on the web.

If you're curious, you can check out the Unity project source [on GitHub](https://github.com/Norgg/cuppa). My favourite commit message is ["Added steam integration"](https://github.com/Norgg/cuppa/commit/a4051f41356416c7bdf99e2d3ca5e0c9f3e657c9).

Also, Norgg's daughter helped by drawing the pictures you can see on the mug and kettle, which was the sweetest thing ever.

Enormous thanks to the organizers of the jam for creating such a fantastic event and to all the other participants for sharing their amazing creativity. I am already looking forward to the next one!

Finally, you cannot drink the tea. Don't worry about it.
