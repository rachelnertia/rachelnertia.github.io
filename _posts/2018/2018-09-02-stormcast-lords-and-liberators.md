My army of [Stormcast Eternals](https://www.warhammer-community.com/2018/05/15/15th-may-faction-focus-stormcast-eternalsgw-homepage-post-3/) is growing. The chap above is a [Lord-Relictor](http://ageofsigmar.wikia.com/wiki/Lord-Relictors), a very gothic sort of priest who can heal friends or zap enemies. He's from the original Age of Sigmar starter set which I bought pre-assembled and half-painted from a friend, so I had to struggle through painting not-in-subassemblies. Which turned out fine in the end. There's only a few places I couldn't really get the brush into, but they're not visible on the final product unless you go looking for them.

I'm particularly pleased with the candles and hourglass, which are coloured purple to connect him to the [Realm of Death](http://ageofsigmar.wikia.com/wiki/Realm_of_Shyish).  

It's such a characterful model and I feel very happy to have painted it!

Where the Relictor is more of a support character, the [Lord-Celestant](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Stormcast-Eternals-Lord-Celestant) is more of a leader. I bought him off eBay quite cheaply because I thought he'd be fun to paint and add to my Skirmish warband. (He was!) He's got a sword, a hammer and a ridiculous hammer-cape, so he can dish out quite a lot of damage while also buffing the soldiers following him. I experimented with using a dark blue wash (Drakenhof Nightshade) to shade the sword and hammer instead of a black one (Nuln Oil) and the result is nice, I think. It's subtle, but it makes the metal look colder and somehow more solid.

Finally, I got through all these guys from the starter set. Like the Relictor, they [Liberators](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Stormcast-Eternals-Liberators-2017) already assembled and partially painted. The process was a bit of a slog in places -- when you're putting the base colours down on 10 models at the same time, it takes a *long* time before you start to see the models looking anything like they will in the end, so it's easy to lost momentum. But I got them done, and now I have a solid battleline of chunky golden boys. 

I now have only to paint the 3 [Prosecutors](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Prosecutors-with-Celestial-Hammers-2017), the 3 [Retributors](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Stormcast-Eternals-Paladins-Retributors) and the [mounted Lord-Celestant](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Stormcast-Eternals-Vandus-Hammerhand) and I will have finished the Stormcast side of the starter box. And I'll have enough of an army to play actual non-Skirmish games of Age of Sigmar. Exciting!
