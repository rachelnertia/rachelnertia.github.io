Things are a bit subdued in my life at the moment. I had major surgery less than 3 weeks ago and am very much just beginning my recovery. While I feel better nearly every day (in more ways than one), it'll be a good few weeks before my life is back to something resembling normal.

In the meantime I've been reading plenty, watching lots of YouTube, and [getting some hobby done](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1046713230649937922) when I'm feeling good enough to sit at a table.

I haven't really had much of the right kind of energy for programming or writing, which seems like a shame because of all the free time, ideas and motivation I have bursting from my seams, but that's okay. I suppose it's best to save my thinky-energy for dealing with real problems should they arise and keeping myself comfortable.

Natalie is being a great help, getting shopping, cooking and generally providing morale support. I feel incredibly grateful to have such a good companion around. My mum has also been excellent, helping us return to Edinburgh from the hospital and doing some shopping for us when she can. I've also received a lot of nice messages and visits from friends and family members that have really helped to keep me happy and comfy.

If this upward trend continues my time in the recovery doldrums will pass by like nothing.
