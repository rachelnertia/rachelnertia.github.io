Following on from the three [Blood Warriors]({% post_url 2018/2018-07-11-blood-warriors %}), I've painted up five of the Khorne Bloodbound's speedy, scrappy horde unit. (Everything in this army is called a blood-something.) They're a huge step up in quality from [Garrek's Reavers](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/1000402076055293953), the first Khorne models I painted, both in terms of quality and in terms of how happy I am with the colour scheme. 

I went through them one at a time, giving myself space to practice painting skin in three different colours. Painting the muscles, scars and such on these guys was an absolute blast and I'm much more confident about painting skin now. I chose the vibrant red and bone trim scheme I debuted on the Blood Warriors and I'm mostly pleased with how it turned out, but I need to improve how I paint the bone sections, which can be quite unsatisfying. After painting the first model (second on the left) I added two new paints to my collection: Screaming Bell and Gehenna's Gold. Together these create a beautiful, vibrant brass I decided to use for the bronze sections of the weapons and armour. My taste is very much about saturated colours and high contrast, so the Balthasar Gold/Sycorax Bronze combo I was using previously just doesn't cut it for me. For the bases, I really wanted to put some skulls down -- perhaps I should create a little box of pre-painted skulls ready to add to bases.

These are horde units, so I'm going to have to learn to paint them faster and smarter if I'm ever going to get through the big group of them that are in the main AoS starter box.

Now that I've finished all the models from the Storm of Sigmar starter set, it's time to move on. I'm not sure what's next. I'm gonna paint a quick and easy [Frostgrave dog](http://www.northstarfigures.com/prod.php?prod=8856) while I make up my mind.
