Hi! This is my attempt to create a blog and portfolio site using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> with hosting provided by <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. Doing things this way rather than the WYSIWYG way appeals to my inner coder; I have as much control as I want, rather than being restricted by the finicky interfaces provided by Weebly or WordPress or Blogger or any one of the many different free, easy-to-use blogging/site-creation options I've tried over the years. It might be trickier, but really there's nothing I can't get used to, and it's good experience for someone who's never really done any web development before. I'm using <a href="https://github.com/poole/poole">Poole</a> as my starting point, following the example of <a href="http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/">this guy</a>.

There's some things I want to get set up and working:

* Disqus comments
* Google Analytics
* Hook up the domain name I registered with this site

Then I want to fiddle with the theme a lot until it suits my tastes. Keep it clean and simple, but give it a bit more flavour.

Also, portfolio things. I'm not sure what that will look like, maybe a page for each project, linked to from a 'Portfolio' page? I guess I'll just make it up as I go along!
