Yup, still plugging away at this. The game should be embedded below.

I've got a bunch of things left to do:

* Title screen.
* Code cleanup.
* Tweak the WebGL build memory size.
* Maybe squeeze in a bit more juice.
* Tweak numbers. 
* Improve the way it looks.
* High score leaderboard.
* <s>Detailed lore and backstory.</s>

The first six are pretty straightforward. The title screen is the work of a few hours. The game's code is a horrible mess which is well overdue a bit of a tidy, but I know where I'm going with that and I've already made inroads. Tweaking the WebGL build memory size is interesting and should help the game run on more computers. Adding more juice is the sort of thing I *could* end up sinking countless hours into, along with tweaking the numbers behind the game and making it look nicer, if I wasn't already very bored of doing so.

The last one -- an online high score leaderboard -- is tricky. It's something I've never done before and it will involve some kind of centralised database. It might mean integrating with some website. I just don't know. Daunting. It's a matter of what I want to do with the game. Put it up on a portal like [Kongregate](http://www.kongregate.com)? How difficult will that be? Let people download it off or play it on [itch.io](http://itch.io) and other places? Heck, could it even be a Steam game..?

Let me know what you think about the changes, and what I ought to do with Flappy Word going forward! If you want you can play [version 1]({% post_url 2015-10-23-flappy-word-v1 %}) and [version 2]({% post_url 2015-12-03-flappy-word-v2 %}).
