Welcome to my first ever roundup of music you might have missed - it might be old, it might be recent, but hopefully I recommend something that's new to you and that you find listenable. I kind of want to put out one of these weekly or at least once a month, but we'll see.

First up is **Molly Nilsson**. I went to see her in Glasgow a few weeks ago. She's really cool. She sings quite melancholy songs.

*1995* is now one of my favourite songs, probably of all time but certainly of this year. I  like how the video and lyrics are wrapped in this surface of 90s-nostalgia, but the song has a much deeper, more timeless theme.

> "So what's wrong with living in the past? It just happens to be the place I saw you last..."

Molly Nilsson's discography is available on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B002MPV4IS?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=Molly%20Nilsson&index=digital-music&search-type=ss). There's probably something for you. I recommend [*I Hope You Die*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPshx-3AFKo).

**Holding The Devil's Hand**

Yeah, yeah, I'm on a melancholy streak. I know. (When am I not?)

It's really good, isn't it?

It sort of reminds me of *Too Late to Love You*. I don't quite understand why. Perhaps it's the singing?

Were you watching The Joy of Painting on twitch.tv? Here's something positive to send the week out:

Every day is a good day if you paint!

I haven't painted in ages. Maybe that's my problem.
