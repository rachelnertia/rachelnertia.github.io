Hard to believe it's only been a week since [the last]({% post_url 2015-11-18-fantastic-beats-01 %}) of these weekly music round-ups, isn't it? Incredible how time rushes by.

I was lucky enough to go and see Chvrches recently here in Dundee. They're an ace band. I can't really think of a single song of theirs which I don't enjoy listening to. Current favourite: the energetic 'Leave A Trace' from their most recent album:

Whether or not you're playing *Fallout 4*, game critic Noah Gervais' three-hour mix of songs which suit the game's aesthetic is full of lovely jazz, rock and blues to bounce along to:

I watched Cartoon Network's *Over the Garden Wall* for the first time a few weeks ago. I can't recommend it enough - it's short, sweet and lovely in every way, especially in its soundtrack. 'Patient is the Night,' one of the series' many short original songs, keeps making me cry, while 'Potatoes and Molasses' makes it impossible to frown.

One more artist. Have you ever heard of The Space Lady? I love The Space Lady. Her music still sounds way ahead of its time decades on, endlessly endearing.

Okay, I'm out of here. I hope there was something new to you in this week's weekly music round-up!
