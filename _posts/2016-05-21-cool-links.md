[**Sandi Metz - Nothing is Something**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29MAL8pJImQ) (keynote speech at RailsConf 2015) Should be interesting and educational for all the programmers out there. Sandi talks about how to tackle object oriented programming problems, and the [Null Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) pattern, the idea of the *Active Nothing*. It's Ruby-focused, but practical Object-Oriented Design lessons are applicable across most languages. [Her speech from the previous year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOM5_V5jLAs) is more about 'life' than programming, but it is very, very worth a watch.

[**Woodland Secrets Ep. 54: Katherine Cross**](http://woodlandsecrets.co/episode/54) -- This was a great episode, with Merritt Kopas and her guest holding a long, in-depth conversation on the subjects of sociology, work, gamification, and online discourse. Katherine Cross' writing on society, culture and games is well worth exploring.

[**Here's a talk about universal basic income**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsG6-eZpqKc). Worth a listen.

You may have heard of 99% Invisible, the excellent design podcast. This episode, [Turf Wars of East New York](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/turf-wars/), contains some excellent historical insight into the widespread issue facing American cities (and other cities around the world) of gentrification, 20th-century shifts in inner city residential demographics, and how inextricably knotted up it all is with US racist and ethnic tension.

>Landlords and real estate investors saw opportunity in the desperation of immigrant populations. They would come to hone two profit-driven tactics that would subsequently shape neighborhoods around the country: fear-induced white flight and predatory lending.
