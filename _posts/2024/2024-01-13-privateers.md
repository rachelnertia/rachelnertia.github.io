After the Splintered Fang I cracked out a quartet of corsairs and crossbow-aelves.

Lokhir Fellheart, the kraken-mask guy, is a cool concept but a somewhat poor execution in metal. The way his right leg sort of melts into his sea-dragon cloak is just dreadful. And the flash! Ugh! As you can also see, I put him on a 32mm base (a Fleetmaster should be on a 25mm base) because he has such a wide pose. It doesn't matter much.

I look forward to getting my hands on the plastic Black Ark Fleetmaster kit so I can see how it compares.

The cloaks turned out particularly well:

*It's basically just Terradon Turquoise with some extra highlights. The interior is Fyreslayer Flesh, highlights and then... Druchii Violet? Something to add some purpley depth.*

I also painted a Darkshard (repeater-crossbowman) to go with them:

After these I have a real hankering to finish up a unit each of Corsairs and Darkshards... and then maybe paint some more Cities of Sigmar aelves :grin:

Here is the complete Darkling Covens warband:

All ready to land on Szargorond and find some treasure in the cursed city of Ulfenkarn! It's not the most competitive warband, but it'll do...
