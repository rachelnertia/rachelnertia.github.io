I was planning to attend a *Kill Team: Badab War* event at the end of February, but in spite of my herculean efforts to swallow my anti-Space Marine pride to assemble a warband, I caught covid and couldn't attend. Which sucked! 

Nonetheless, by the time I realised I wasn't going to make it I had already done all the hobby I needed to do, producing eight Space Marines of the Marines Errant chapter, all fresh, shiny and ready to wage civil war.

*The Tactical Sergeant, leader of my kill team.*

*Kill Team: Badab War* is a fan-made modification (module? supplement? hack?) for *Kill Team* based on the Badab War: a historical conflict in the Warhammer 40,000 setting in which various Space Marine chapters went to war with each other over taxes. It is available as [a PDF](https://ossifiedsite.files.wordpress.com/2022/08/kill-team-badab-war-v09.pdf) in which there are special rules for assembling Space Marine kill teams from the various chapters who took part. 

Once I had decided to attend the meetup I thumbed through the PDF and settled upon the [Marines Errant](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Marines_Errant) chapter, who appealed because they are sailors (hello) and can make use of xenotech (alien weaponry).

*The Tactical fireteam. The shuriken catapult counts as a bolter.*

I was lucky to be given sprues for [Mark VI marines](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/legiones-astartes-mk6-tactical-squad-2022) by my friend Pete (AKA Fiyenyaa). I have a soft spot for beaky Marines, so that was a great start. After that, I bought bases and bits from eBay, chose [Fafnir Rann](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/horus-heresy-imperial-fists-fafnir-rann-2022) to convert into my Void War Veteran (a specialist available to the Marines Errant), and sourced some Eldar bits from my own bits box.

*A Breacher with an Eldar fusion gun, which counts as a slightly better melta gun which can explode and hurt the user. It may seem non-codex compliant at first glance, but there's a purity seal, so it's okay.*

I got to stretch my kitbashing, conversion and sculpting muscles on this project. These are not normally things I do a lot of. Kara helpfully guided me through the process of giving my Tactical Sergeant a tabard using a small bit of aluminium sheet (from a Coke can) and green stuff, and how to make purity seals from green stuff and thin metal sheet (copper I think?).

*The Void War Veteran, a support operative joining the kill team to help out.*

The freehand on the shoulder pads (and elsewhere on the Void War Veteran) was another strike into unfamiliar territory for me. It took me a lot of patience and attempts even though it is a very simple insignia.

Maybe one day I will get to play *Kill Team: Badab War* with them as intended.
