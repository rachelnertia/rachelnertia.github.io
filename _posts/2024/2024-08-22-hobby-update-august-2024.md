Hobby has been slow this summer. After reaching 1500 points of Ogres for Kings of War, I never got around to even buying the final 500 points. It took me a whole month to paint 10 Vanquishers and a chariot for my Stormcast army (allowing me to run Yndrasta's Spearhead). And I barely even started the models I needed to paint up for the other Spearheads. 

On the other hand, I have been very excited about hobby -- even moreso than usual! -- and have played a lot of games. 

The main event has been Age of Sigmar 4th edition, which to my tastes is a very successful ground-up redesign of the system. I've enjoyed every game played so far, especially of Spearhead, and have come away from every match wanting more. I have a lot of thoughts ðŸ¤” which I hope to write and pod about soon. 

Consequently I've had a lot more inspiration to buy, build and paint AoS minis than time to actually do it in. Nonetheless I'm currently working on some Dark Riders for my Cities of Sigmar army:

*This is a late-WHFB (early 2010s) Dark Elf kit that really holds up. I think all the Dark Elf kits from that era hold up well, but would hold up a lot better if they had as much dynamism as these models do.*

*My progress so far. This is the unit champion, who has crazy hair.*

I like the new rules for Cities and all my 2000-point games of 4th so far have been played using them. I want to try my other armies, but this is the one I'm most excited about playing and painting. Hobby-wise I'm hoping to round out my dark aelf collection[^1] and then see about some duardin[^2] and maybe a few humans[^3].

[^1]: While I still can ðŸ˜°
[^2]: I probably only have a year or so of Dispossessed still being part of the army, so I better crack on if I want to get them on the table.
[^3]: The humans, on the other hand, are definitely here to stay. The new ones, at least... so I'd better grab the older ones I want (Battlemages, Griffon...) soon.

The *other* (much more personally important) event is the [Magewinds][mw] Meetup I'm running on 16th-17th November. That's alarmingly soon, given the amount of work on the game I want to complete before then. I gotta add things, change things, polish things, and come up with some event-specific scenarios and maybe even a bit of a story. Fortunately my attendees are great people and so I will be able to delegate some of the tasks. Delegating is good! ðŸ’ª

This last week, my work on Magewinds has mostly consisted of learning how to use [Pandoc][pd] and how to write [Haskell][hs] in order to use it in a more advanced fashion. So far it has been frustrating and rewarding in equal measure[^4].

[hs]: https://www.haskell.org/

[^4]: So like all programming, then.

Anyway, I'd better get back to it. I hope your hobby journey is going well! 

It's off topic, but I must share this nice picture I took of the River Findhorn while cycling near my aunt's house at the weekend:
