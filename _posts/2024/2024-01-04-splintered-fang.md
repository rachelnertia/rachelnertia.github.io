I began my hobby year by finishing off a *Warcry* warband I was painting for my friend Roland.

*The leader of the Splintered Fang. A real all-time favourite model of mine. Love the concept, love the execution, love the pose. One day I think I shall have my own.*

These are the Splintered Fang, one of the original Chaos warbands released for *Warcry*. Each warband in this initial series represents what worshippers of the Dark Powers might look like when coming from one of the eight Mortal Realms that make up the *Age of Sigmar* setting. 

The Splintered Fang are from Ghyran, the Realm of Life, and worship the Coiling Ones -- Chaos entities who claim to be descended from the dead godbeast Nagendra. They love snakes!

*Although this guy loves snakes a little bit too much!*

When Warcry came out in 2019 I got my friend Roland into it and he bought, built and partially painted this warband. A few months ago I fancied painting a Splintered Fang warband, remembered he had one, and offered to paint his for him. Kindly he obliged and -- very slowly -- I got on with the job.

*This model is the only currently-available Chaos aelf. I think there should be a lot more like them.*

Roland had painted the blades icy blue and, though I had *carte blanche* to do whatever I wanted, I took the striking colour choice and ran with it.

Painting these took a long time, in part because I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to approach them and in part because I was trying my best. I still don't think they're quite 'finished' as there are so many highlights I could tweak or parts I could try to repaint, but at a certain point you gotta say "Fuck it, that'll do."

*A big mook. Everyone in the warband has a snakebite somewhere on their body from some kind of initiation ceremony.*

While I painted I reflected on how much I like *Warcry* and the original series of Chaos warbands in particular. The game is fantastic, probably my favourite Games Workshop offering. If you like skirmish games you should give it a go. The warbands add so much detail to the Mortal Realms, demonstrating how diverse tribes, cultures and civilisations are shaped by Chaos. Chaos Undivided isn't just armour-clad musclebound Norscan himbos now, and that's great.

Also while I painted I reflected on the experience of painting models for someone else. I feel warm and fuzzy and perhaps a little bit closer to my friend, whose friendship I value greatly -- but I *also* kind of want to keep the warband. Is this how commission painters feel?
