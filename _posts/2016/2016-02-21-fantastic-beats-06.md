*Everyone in the office gasps as you gingerly peel open the letter to reveal a thin magazine. You hold it up in the dusty sunlight streaming through the window. "There hasn't been a new one of those in ages!" exclaims one of your coworkers. The new kid looks puzzled. "What is it?" she asks. "It's a pseudoperiodical. One of the greatest," you tell her reverently. "Music you might have missed."*

It's been too long!

PWR BTTM have been worming their way around my ear-tubes recently, something which I have no problem with. Ugly Cherries is a very good album - energetic, earnest queer pop-punk seems to be exactly what I need at the moment.

[LEVEL MUSIC PURCHASE](https://levelmusicmaxo.bandcamp.com/album/level-music-purchase) is an adorable idea: a videogamey soundtrack to listen to as you journey around the campus of State University of New York at Purchase, with tracks for different buildings and spaces. I've never been to SUNY Purchase and doubt I ever will, so I'm left forever wondering about what it's actually like to listen to the album the way it was intended. What about you?

Golden Fable have been releasing short EPs monthly for a while. The latest, Burning Song, has a track I adore:

> Oh the lethargy / Lie dormant / A slumber in peace 

You should totally check out their [other stuff](https://fullofjoyrecords.bandcamp.com/), especially the older stuff they produced under the majestic band name *Tim and Sam's Tim and the Sam Band with Tim and Sam*, such as [Life Stream](https://fullofjoyrecords.bandcamp.com/album/life-stream).

Happy listening, folks!
