*You hear it crawling into your ears, accompanied by hisses of static: music you might have missed.*

### Junk

New M83 album!

**Who are M83?** M83 created [Midnight City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX3k_QDnzHE) and the incredible *Hurry Up, We're Dreaming*, an album which still gets my heart thumping as much as it did back when I first listened to it in, **gosh**, **2011**. (Holy shit!)

[*Junk*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CZ4TImzrFlnd8hl5XaQJy5azWrIWu3o) is lovely and lively and I'm just as impressionable as I was back then, so I've been listening to it a fair bit.

Favourite track: Road Blaster

### Trevor Something

*Trevor Something Does Not Exist* is an album. I like the track that samples Blue Monday, and the Enjoy the Silence cover. And all the stuff in between, I guess.

### Howard Shore

I recently discovered [Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJkMlOu7faDgqh4PfzbpLdg) on YouTube. His video on the music of the *Lord of the Rings* films is excellent and helps to explain just why those movies are so special to me:

### Other Things

Beulah - [Emma Blowgun's Last Stand](https://www.youtube.com/embed/JCctLb83e5o)

There's a cover/remix of Tracy Chapman's [Fast Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTIB10eQnA0) going round, but the original is still really really really good.

The Replacements - [Can't Hardly Wait](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wigclcg3stc)

That's enough music writing by someone who doesn't know how to write about music for now. See ya!
