It's another pseudo-weekly round up of music you might have missed...

### Grimes

Grimes' new album [Art Angels](http://shopusa.4ad.com/art-angels) has been out for a month or so now. The video for 'Kill V. Maim' dropped onto the Internet a few days ago.

Energetic but sinister, rebellious yet graceful, I don't see how anyone can watch this video and not want to be part of Grimes' neon vampire clan. Kill V. Maim convinced me to finally buy Art Angels and give it a fair shake. I really like it. Feels like 2016 is going to be a dancing-to-Grimes-lots year[^1] and I'm more than happy with that. 

I have weird feelings about the album version of 'REALiTi' -- would I like it if the [version from March '15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA) hadn't been a staple of my music diet since it released? Or is it just straight up not as good?

### Warcraft

I've been pining for Azeroth pretty bad recently. Pray for me.

I'm not sure if listening to my favourite music from *World of Warcraft* is helping or hindering my efforts to stay away.

- [Ashenvale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyEAlMKUzbM)
- [Elwynn Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNz18Wk13h8)

[The *Warcraft 3* soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ1jlcuFPdA) is the bees knees, too.

### Adele

Adele's latest hit, [Hello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQHsXMglC9A), has been deservingly storming the airwaves recently, but do you remember her earlier work? I didn't even realise 2008's Chasing Pavements *was* Adele, but, thinking back, who the hell else could it have been?

Have a great week, folks. <3
