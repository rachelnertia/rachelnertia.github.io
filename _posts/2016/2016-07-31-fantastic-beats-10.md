*You slowly pull the closet door open, wary of what might be lurking on the other side, but... there isn't a closet on the other side! Instead, there's a big, open-plan office full of busy-looking people, tapping away at keyboards, chatting to each other, listening appreciatively to music on big, heavy-duty headphones. One of them notices you over the top of a record sleeve she is inspecting. "Hello there!" She says warmly.*

*"Wh.. what is this?" You inquire, gesturing dumbly at the office in your closet.*

*"This place? It's the Ministry of Music You Might Have Missed -- back by popular demand. Have a wander around!"*

Hello. What have you been up to? I've been playing a fair amount of *Fallout 4* and *Fallout: New Vegas*, which means I've got a lot of 1950s/1960s rock, pop and jazz stuck in my head and on my mind. Here's some Eddie Cochran:

I quite like Nat King Cole, too. ['Love Me As Though There Were No Tomorrow'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALXfCIhrHvk) always makes me happy when it comes on the radio in *New Vegas*, but 'Unforgettable' is so big and huge and, y'know, unforgettable:

What kind of music do you listen to while working? For me it has to be stuff that I can listen to without thinking about it, and it has to give me good, energetic vibes. Stuff like the chilled-out instrumental hip-hop of the *Samurai Champloo* soundtrack, then, is perfect for me:

Personal favourite: [Aruarian Dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYRDgd3Tb44).

What have you been listening to? What music might *I* have missed?
