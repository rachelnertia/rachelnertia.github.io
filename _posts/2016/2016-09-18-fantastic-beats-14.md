### Desperately Seeking Susan

I watched this film for the first time last night. It's really good! It has one of those timeless heartwarming comedy-of-errors stories that could be set in any place or time, but the actors who make up its cast, the look and feel of the thing, land it squarely in its own time -- the mid-1980s. No element contributes to this sense of temporality more than its excellent score [^1].

The soundscape of blasting synths and looping artificial drumbeats carry over into Madonna's very danceable contribution to the soundtrack.

Yeah, Madonna's in it. She's pretty fucking good in it, too, if her character is a bit oppressively cool.

What music has been living in your ears recently? And where is the vapourwave track that samples from this movie's score?

[^1]: I wasn't alive in the 1980s. I know it's not what the 80s were actually like in their entirety, but *Desperately Seeking Susan* embodies the 80s-zeitgeist that has been passed down to me through the culture.
