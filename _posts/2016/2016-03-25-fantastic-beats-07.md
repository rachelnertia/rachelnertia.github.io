Hello. It's time for the always-weekly music linkdump. This week I went a [bit](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/713159715761553411) [MIDI](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/713152663366602753)-[mad](https://twitter.com/nershly/status/712761815424507907). [I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xolp_DuqOBs) [have](http://awfulmidis.tumblr.com/post/139263325292) [no](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psIdan9GSRM) [regrets](http://awfulmidis.tumblr.com/post/141445077972).

*Ahem*. Anyway! On to music which people who aren't just me find listenable. Pretty mixed bag this week...

[Cheap Talk's *Let's Get Electric*](https://cheaptalk.bandcamp.com/) is featured in [*Firewatch*](http://www.firewatchgame.com/), which I haven't played yet. As contemporary-artists-pretending-to-be-1980s-synthpop-artists goes, it's lovely stuff. My favourite track is Flashback. This is not Flashback:

[David Ferguson](https://www.youtube.com/user/DaveboTheOtherPerson) alerted me to the existence of [Blockhead](https://ninjatune.net/artist/blockhead), for which I am very grateful.

Moon Hooch are good, if you like jazz:

I've also been listening to a fair bit of classical music, like [Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1 Op. 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPa7jjeKVR4).

Finally, I rediscovered Semisonic's 'Closing Time' and immediately went and sang it at karaoke. It very very very very good!

Until next time, folks, have a great week(s)!
