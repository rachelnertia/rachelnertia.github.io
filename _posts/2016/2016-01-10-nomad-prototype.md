## An Unfinished Prototype

This was going to be an exploration-focused game about scavenging your way around asteroid fields and derelict space stations using a suite of clunky and unconventional movement tools. I got stuck in, began working on a grappling gun attachment which you could swap out a thruster for... and then the rest of Summer 2015 happened. This weekend I reopened the Unity project, made the game presentable, and decided to put it out as it is.

I'd like to come back to it -- the idea's been kicking around in my head for about 3 years and it wants out pretty bad -- but it probably won't happen in the immediate future. At least this way the game gets out into the world.
