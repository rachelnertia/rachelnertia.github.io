*Hey. You. Yeah, you. The one with the audio speakers. Turn 'em on. Turn 'em up. Here's some music you might have missed...*

### The War of the Ring

Did anyone else play *War of the Ring*? No, not the [board game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115746/war-ring-second-edition). I'm talking about [the PC RTS](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lord-Rings-War-Ring-PC/dp/B00009LW8A) developed by Liquid Entertainment and published by Sierra. Well, it was... okay. Sort of. It had a great soundtrack, regardless, composed by Lennie Moore. [Have a listen to the whole thing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D9358DCD4B763AD). It's like a musical tour of Middle Earth, written with very different priorities from [Howard Shore's cinematic score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SBQvd6vY9s).

Maybe it's just nostalgia for the game itself (which hasn't aged well, technically speaking, and wasn't particularly special in the first place), but this assortment of melody-driven pieces makes me feel calm, collected and remarkably at-home.

Let me know what you've been listening to lately in the comments or on Twitter or whatever. I love to follow other people's music-listening journeys as much as I find it fascinating to chart my own. See ya! <3
