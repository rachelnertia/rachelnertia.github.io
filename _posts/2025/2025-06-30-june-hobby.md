*Phoenix Lord Fuegan of the Fire Dragons.*

June was a very productive hobby month, featuring plenty of elfs.

## News

Para Bellum announced that the [Weaver Courts](https://www.para-bellum.com/weaver-courts/) are coming to *Conquest*. This put me on notice that at some point in the next few months all other hobby projects will have to stand aside to make way for big bug-plant-elf hybrid models, so I've been thinking carefully about how I want to spend the intervening hobby time. I can't wait for PB to reveal more.

## Games Played: 3

All I played this month was Path to Glory. The first two games were to help Mark catch up on the games he missed out on by missing May's meetup. I couldn't gain any Emberstone, so I wouldn't get too far ahead, but to keep things fair I also couldn't gain any injuries. Mark's Seraphon neatly won the first game, but my Spiderfang Grots took their revenge in the second.

Most of the group couldn't make it on the day of our June meetup, so Dave and myself ended up just playing a game at my flat. We advanced onto the next set of scenarios and ended up playing one where Dave's Maggotkin were tasked with assassinating my general.

But Scuttleboss Skulkrawla was far too wily for them, and snuck away while his underlings kept the enemy at bay (and ate most of them). Dave's Great Unclean One deployed in a corner, stuck behind some Plaguebearers and some rocks, and was not the threat he could have been.

## Models Finished: 38

I finished painting my **Wood Elf** collection for Warmaster. The final push consisted of a bunch of heroes, 3 more Warhawk Riders, and a load of infantry.

To celebrate, I painted up a couple more 10mm Forest Dragon models I had lying around. The first was a **Goblin Boss on Giant Spider** that Kara printed me as a wee gift:

The second was a **High Elf Lord on Dragon** that Rich sent me by accident instead of the Forest Dragon he meant to ðŸ˜†

I am afraid to admit it, but both these models have ignited a desire to paint more of their respective armies. It didn't help that I spent some time this month, while ill, reading 2007's *Warhammer Armies: High Elves* cover-to-cover...

**Marshall Ashfield and Squire Udo**, this year's Warhammer+ subscriber miniatures, were next. I made a small modification, swapping out Udo's head for a slightly sinister one from my Stormcast bits box, but otherwise they are unchanged. They've whetted my appetite for painting more of the new Cities of Sigmar range.

I worked on an **Excelsior Warpriest** (and his gryph-hound companion!) at the same time. He's from *Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower*, and represents an aesthetic direction Games Workshop could have gone in with Cities of Sigmar, one that hews closer to the first few waves of Stormcast Eternals.

I'm mostly happy with him, but I sometimes find painting dark skin tones a little tricky, and this was one of those times. Definitely an area I'd like to gain confidence in.

These four brave leaders join the ranks of my Nuloren army, although I'm not sure when they'll see action...

Finally, **Phoenix Lord Fuegan** (see above). This model was a gift from Kara for helping her out earlier in the year. My Eldar are metallic and I approach them from a speedpainting angle (so I can get the space-elf bug out of my system quickly), so Fuegan was an experiment in tinting the metal with coats of ink. I'd tried this before, on Striking Scorpions, but it worked better this time -- perhaps because the orange and scarlet inks I used were better suited for the job than green, or perhaps because this time the inks were going over a Metal Color Aluminium undercoat, rather than Silver.

Looking at him now, I'm still not happy with the banner. I shall have to revisit it some day.

## Acquisitions

I didn't get any new models this month (ðŸ˜‡)[^1], but I picked up the new General's Handbook for *Age of Sigmar*, along with the new Spearhead battleback, *Sand and Bone*. They both seem good, and I'm itching to get stuck into them in July. Itching so much, in fact, that I've signed up for a Spearhead tournament at the end of the month. I hope I can get some practice before then!

## Works in Progress

Right now I have 10 dark aelf **Bleakswords** on the go, reinforcements for Nuloren's Darkling Covens.

It's quite possible I'll end up spending all my hobby time in July painting dark elves.

I've also managed to get my Magewinds mojo back and am working on [an update](https://www.magewinds.com/blog/2025/06/11/magewinds-in-2025/).
