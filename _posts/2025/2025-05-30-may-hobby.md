I made good progress in May, despite being away for the beginning of it.

## Games Played: 3

I played 3 games of AoS this month. The first was a 2000-point General's Handbook battle (probably my last of the 2024 edition) against David's awesome Shyishian Sylvaneth.

*I lost, but we had a very fun game. It was my Hydra's first outing on the table... and probably last -- its rules are weak. I would have done better with my usual third Steam Tank.*

Then we had session 3 of our ongoing *Path to Glory: Ravaged Coast* campaign. My first battle was versus Dave's Maggotkin of Nurgle.

This was a great victory for the Spiderfang grots. After I killed all his friends, Dave's new Great Unclean One (built using a Mancrusher Gargant) simply left the battlefield. Which was good because I didn't want to fight it. My Spiders have started to get good, both as they level up and as I learn to pilot them better.

My second battle of the day was against Dimitrios' Stormcast.

This was a painfully one-sided game -- the Stormcast simply didn't have the tools necessary to deal with the spiders, and are incredibly weak to their main strength: shitloads of mortal damage. You can have as much armour as you want. My spiders simply do not notice it.

## Models Finished: 34

|               Project                | Number of Models |
| :----------------------------------: | :--------------: |
| Sisters of Twilight on Forest Dragon |        1         |
|                Dryads                |        9         |
|               Treekin                |        9         |
|               Treemen                |        2         |
|             Branchwraith             |        1         |
|             Wild Riders              |        6         |
|             Glade Riders             |        6         |

Everything above is 10mm, sculpted by [Forest Dragon](https://forestdragon.gumroad.com/) for [Warmaster](https://www.wm-revolution.com/). I count each base of models as a single model. Any other way of counting 10mm models is madness.

*The Sisters of Twilight, riding their Forest Dragon. The wings are sculpted to resemble leaves, and I was inspired to paint them like those of a Pink Splash Caladium, which turned out very striking. I'll run them as any of the hero choices that can be mounted on a dragon.*

*Motivated by finishing the dragon, I got on with all the brown stuff. Not much to say here. They're just nice straightforward sculpts which paint up very quickly.*

*It took significantly longer to work my way through the cavalry, in spite of my best efforts to make the process fast. I couldn't stomach the thought of painting them all the same, so I made each unit distinct. This might help in battles where sometimes it can get hard to tell which unit a stand belongs to.*

## Acquisitions

As I write this I am wracking my brain, convinced that I **must** have bought or been given *something*, but... it doesn't seem like I have acquired anything at all! Which perhaps makes May 2025 the first time my hobby input/output ratio has been greater than 1 in *years*?

A chilling thought. If this trend continues I might actually paint all my models ðŸ¤®

## Works in Progress

- **Warmaster Wood Elves**

I'm pretty sure that by the end of June I can have dug myself out of the Warmaster Hole. I have the following to paint:

|      Unit       | Number of Bases |
| :-------------: | :-------------: |
| Warhawk Riders  |        3        |
|  Eternal Guard  |        3        |
|   Glade Guard   |        9        |
|   Waywatchers   |        4        |
|   Wardancers    |        3        |

Then I have a bunch of heroes to get through. They'll be 100% fun, though.

After the Wood Elfs I have a few Warmaster extras: a **Goblin Boss on Giant Spider** which Kara printed on a whim, a **High Elf Lord on Dragon** which Rich printed and gave to me by accident. I binned off the mostly-broken Ogre army that finally arrived (sadly transport had not been kind to all the brittle, brittle 3D printer resin) but I kept two **Giants** which will be fun to paint.

Seeking refuge from 10mm, I made a start on my **Excelsior Warpriest**.

I'll be dipping in and out of painting him and his gryph-hound friend while I work my way through the Wood Elf glut.
