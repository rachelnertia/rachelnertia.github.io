The air is crisp and the year is beginning to wind down.

## Games Played: 5

All Age of Sigmar all the time, baby. My first ever tournament was on the 20th, which I've written about [here]({% post_url 2025/2025-09-21-capital-punishment-2 %}), before which I managed to play a couple of practice games with my final all-spiders list. Both were against Idoneth Deepkin, albeit slightly different lists, and in both I somehow came out on top.

I got my Spiderfang models finished, rounding out my 2000-point all-spiders Gitz list.

For my [first model review over on Goonhammer](https://www.goonhammer.com/conquest-weaver-courts-oberon-model-review/) I built and painted up Oberon, Consort of Summer.

And I painted some wee things too: Maleneth, Gotrek's erstwhile Daughter of Khaine companion in the Mortal Realms; a cool wizard from [Black Scorpion Miniatures](https://www.blackscorpionminiatures.com/); and a repaint of an old objective marker I wasn't happy with. (I'm still not.)

Maleneth was a study in purple...

...while this model was a study in brown, a colour I usually avoid.

## Acquisitions: 1

At the AoS tournament I went to I won best painted and was rewarded with a lil' vampire lord.

## Works in Progress: None

More Weavers are on the way for me to review for Goonhammer, so I can't commit to any big projects right now. Before they arrive I might see if I can squeeze out a unit of Squigs and maybe some other Gitz models.

## Magewinds

A little progress was made, but I have been so busy with other stuff. Alas. Maybe I shall do some more work on it this evening. 

Here's a cool bit of art for it that I've been slowly chipping away at, though:
