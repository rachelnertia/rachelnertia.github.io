March was a busy month, starting off with a RMRO (RollModels Roll Out!) meetup.

At RMRO I played two full-fat games of AoS with my newly-battletome'd Gloomspite Gitz army. Good fun. Got stomped by Been's skeletons in the first game, and did horrible things to Kaeloth's Nighthaunt in game two.

I'm keen to play some more with the army at 2000 points, where it seems like Spiderfang are: OK.

Also at RMRO I got to introduce Caelyn of [Rascal News](https://www.rascal.news/) to Magewinds. She seemed to enjoy it and even shouted it out on the [Rascal podcast](https://www.rascal.news/rascal-walks-the-longest-road/), which led to a complete stranger wandering into the Magewinds Discord server, which was a pleasant surprise. I really ought to do more work on the game...

I played a game of Warcry in the office with my latest warband, the Wildercorps Hunters, albeit not fully painted. My opponent's Slaanesh knights eked out a victory against my superior numbers, but I got to do fun stuff with dogs.

Near the end of the month the group I helped assemble had our first day of *Path to Glory: Ravaged Coast* gaming. I am trying to make Spiderfang work in the format, which may be foolish. Certainly it seems foolish after my first two battles, during which my brittle arachnids did not do enough damage and generally got their fangs kicked in. A shame, but I managed to extract just enough Emberstone (the resource the campaign system uses) to afford to add my faction's terrain to my army, so in April I shall have a Loonshrine and be able to get more value out of my Spider Riders. I'm not sure how much difference that will make, but I'll struggle bravely on nonetheless.

## Models Finished: 11

|       Project       | Number of Models |
| :-----------------: | :--------------: |
| Magewinds Fighters  |        3         |
| Emberstone Clusters |        8         |

I painted three models for Magewinds, pictured above. Left: a Wizard? Middle: a Druid. Right: a Duellist. As always painting one-offs like this is such a joy.

![Emberstone Clusters](/images/2025/03/march-hobby/emberstone-clusters.jpg)

The Emberstone Clusters were hastily made for the Path to Glory campaign. They are made of foam, cork and sand. They deserve a little more love (even just painting the rims of the bases...) but they look good enough to play with.

**EDIT(20/04/25):** I forgot to mention the scaled-down Dark Fantastic Mills crab hut that I painted as part of a joint experiment with Kara. She shrunk down (to 10mm-ish scale) the STLs and printed off two huts in FDM, which we each took one of. Mine is the one on the left, in a moody, mossy style. Hers is the one on the right, in a punchy high-contrast scheme which she doesn't normally go for -- I hope she paints more minis like this!

## Acquisitions

- **Droggz da Sunchompa**

![Droggz da Sunchompa](/images/2025/03/march-hobby/droggz.jpg)

A friend who picked up two of the Gitmob box and didn't need an additional Droggz passed it on to me, for which I'm very grateful. Although it does raise the issue of me not having enough other wolf-riding friends for him to play with...

- **Gloomspite Gitz Endless Spells**

![Gloomspite Gitz Endless Spells](/images/2025/03/march-hobby/gitz-spells.jpg)

During RMRO in Bathgate we made our customary visit to [Marionville Models](https://www.marionvillemodels.com) near Livingstone. I felt sufficiently buoyed by my two games of AoS with my Gitz the day before to pick up the army's spells. They should be a lot of fun to paint, and all have pretty nice rules now.

- **Wildercorps Hunters**. I was kindly gifted these by Caelyn. Thanks Caelyn!

- **Marshal Ashfield and Squire Udo**

![Marshal Ashfield and Squire Udo](/images/2025/03/march-hobby/marshal.jpg)

The Warhammer Plus subscriber miniatures who were so cool I had to subscribe. I've watched some of the content on Warhammer TV. It's... fine. *SIGH.* Oh and I can make multiple army lists on the Age of Sigmar app. Beyond the two models, the service does not offer great value for money.

I swapped out Udo's head for an equally weird one from my Stormcast bits box, which I prefer.

## Works in Progress

- The **War Hydra**, still! No progress made here.
- **Wildercorps Hunters** - these have taken longer than I hoped. The sooner I finish writing this update the sooner I can make a bit more progress on them though. I hope to have them finished within a couple days.

As a way of avoiding making progress on the above I also built everything I acquired (mentioned above) and primed most of it. I also built and primed an Excelsior Warpriest and his gryph-hound companion who I shall be running as a Freeguild Marshal and Relic Envoy at some point.

Looking ahead, in April I'll be in London for a long weekend during which I'm planning to visit [Salute](https://southlondonwarlords.co.uk/what-is-salute). There will also be session two of our *Ravaged Coast* campaign. Please wish my spiders good luck üôè
