*Of the many factions and cultures that dwell in the great tree-city of Nuloren, few are as sinister as the denizens of the Darkling Covens. Fewer still have sacrificed as much in defence of the realm. Often have these shadowy aelves given their lives in droves, shining ranks of ensorcelled warriors bearing the brunt of enemy charges while their commanding sorceresses hurl evil magicks overhead. It doesn't help that said sorceresses have no qualms about using the life-force of their underlings to empower themselves...*

I figured it was time this branch of the Nuloren armed forces got some reinforcements.

First, we have the Dark Elf Warriors I left unpainted in November when I was churning out models for the army I took to the Rollmodels meetup in Bathgate. 14 models, some of whom have a thick layer of seemingly-unstrippable ancient paint underneath their fresh coat, giving them a slightly lumpy appearance that is fortunately only noticeable up close.

Serendipitously I found the command models, pictured above, going at an affordable price on eBay. Here they are in formation with the 14 rank-and-file, plus a reference model from the previous batch:

I run them as [Bleakswords](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Dark-Elves-Bleakswords), which they're a perfect fit for, being simply older versions of the same model. With this group done I now have enough models to run two units of 20, or a big unit of 30 and a unit of 10.

Meanwhile I had 5 Black Guard left over. The person I bought them from must have used the other 5 for a conversion, perhaps? Or maybe they used to come in boxes of 15?

Five Black Guard is not enough for a whole unit, but fortunately I had one very old metal Black Guard sitting in a box[^1]. This gave me the idea of picking up four more Black Guard of the same time period on eBay.

A unit of 20 Black Guard is quite a fun thing in the game, too, at least against things that aren't mega heavily-armoured, because they put out a *lot* of attacks, most of which land.

*Thus reinforced, the Darkling Covens of Nuloren are eager for opponents to test their increased strength against...*
