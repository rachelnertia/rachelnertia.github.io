I released a game today! It's called *Magewinds*, and it's a tabletop miniature skirmish wargame in which everyone is a wizard.

The game has a [website](http://www.magewinds.com/) where you can find *all* the rules, completely free, presented in [web-browsable format](http://www.magewinds.com/rules).

*Magewinds* is the culmination of far too many years of daydreaming, experimenting, prototyping, playtesting and polishing, with the [help](http://www.magewinds.com/thanks/) of so many lovely people. 

And it's not even really *done* yet! We're only just beginning our adventures in Tempestia...
