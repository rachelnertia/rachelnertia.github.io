Last weekend I travelled down to Stockport (near Manchester) for a Rollmodels meetup (a "Rollmodels Roll Out") at [Element Games North West](https://elementgames.co.uk/north-west-gaming-centre). It was an excellent time!

On Saturday morning I played most of an Open War game of Age of Sigmar against 
LeSwordfish's pretty Seraphon army. 

My Nighthaunt stood up well, managing to take out the enemy general Saurus on Carnosaur when it charged into the right flank (he disappeared in a swarm of chainrasps), but ultimately couldn't handle the magical onslaught coming from the Slann Mage-Priest[^1] and all the Skink shooting. 

Kurdoss managed to break through and take out the Razordons (a terrifying shooting unit), but they promptly respawned behind my line because my opponent had the Reinforcements ruse.

He then made a Hail Mary charge through the enemy line and squished the accursed Slann (shown above - photo credit: LeSwordfish), before being speared by many, many Saurus Warriors. As it was now midday we decided to call it there. I think my opponent would have won, but there was a chance of victory for me if I got lucky with priority and moved well.

I concluded I didn't have the stamina for more AoS, and made the switch to skirmish games for the rest of the weekend.

That afternoon I played two games of Warhammer Underworlds with my newly-painted Elathain's Soulraid.

It was fun! Thanks to Cronch and Scops for the games.

I feel like Rivals format is about the level of engagement I want to have with the game, and the Soulraid have a pretty good warband deck that provides plenty of flexibility and interesting gameplay to explore. I want to play more...

Others at the event were playing AoS, 40k, Kill Team, Warcry, Necromunda, [Saga](https://www.grippingbeast.co.uk/SAGA.html), [0200 Hours](https://greyfornow.com/pages/02-hundred-hours), Underworlds, Blood Bowl, and probably others I didn't notice or have forgotten. It was lovely to see people, catch up, and watch so many games being enjoyed.

In the evening I unwrapped my Secret Santa gift, that had mysteriously appeared under the Christmas tree next to Michael's 0200 Hours table:

HELL yeah. Thanks Santa! Will be painting them up soon.

On Sunday, I taught [Magewinds](www.magewinds.com) to two brave volunteers. They seemed to have a good time, and I noticed a mistake in the rules on the website (fixed now!), so all in all it was time well spent. I would have liked to have played more!

Me and Kara played a fun game of Warcry, in which I managed to eke out a victory right at the end. And then, after a quick raid of the extremely well-stocked Element Games shop, it was time to travel back.

I definitely wasn't 100% recovered from covid at the weekend, as I re-irritated my throat with all the talking and kept having nasty sinus headaches. This put a damper on things but I'm just glad I was able to come at all.

Many thanks to Axolotlquestions for driving us there and back, to Peter for organising the meetup, and to Element Games for hosting and for being such an impressive venue!

Now the long wait until the next RMRO I can attend begins...
