I'm on a terrain kick! The best kind of kick.

First of all, I finally painted the rest of the Warhammer Fortress:

While I was working my way through that I cut up some foam to make some nice flat-topped, steep-sloped hills:

These should be much easier to play with than the previous hills I made, which have much longer, 45-degree angle slopes that are kind of awkward to measure distances around.

I then made some foam steps to accompany the Fortress so I can configure it in more ways without having first-floor doors that open onto nothing.

Neat, huh?

And now I'm finally doing something useful with my boxes full of empty sprues:
