Lately I've been painting up some classic Middle-Earth elves, starting with some archers:

And some blade-wielding warriors:

These models are like ur-Warhammer, to me, being among the first Games Workshop kits I ever saw and laid hands on.  These particular models may in fact be the very same ones I got in that [Warriors of the Last Alliance](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Warriors-Of-The-Last-Alliance-2018) box, sometime back in 2001 or whenever. Some of them, at least - I think a good few of them were Katamari'd up from other places, such as Nat's parents' attic.

I admire their simple elegance.

I went for a greeny-blue colour scheme. The gold armour is Vallejo Metal Color Gold washed with Coelia Greenshade, while the capes are a dark grey-blue in the recesses and green on the edges and creases. Terradon Turquoise, a personal favourite, also made an appearance. I like it, and it's pretty fast!

I also managed to acquire some of the ones with spears and shields second-hand. I even purchased a blister of 4 of the current finecast versions available for sale [on the GW website](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/High-Elf-Warriors). I don't completely regret that purchasing decision, but *oh lord* were the metal ones better to work with. 

I also bought the [Elf Command](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Elf-Command) blister. Thankfully these two guys are still made in metal.

I suppose I should paint something on the banner, but I don't know what. Also freehand is hard and slow.

Finally I painted up the mounted Glorfindel I've had for many years. I painted the on-foot version that came in the same blister a couple of years ago, but in a different colour scheme. Maybe I'll go back and repaint him to match?

He's on a rectangular base instead of the circular one he's meant to go on because, ultimately, I'm planning to use these models to play [Oathmark](https://ospreypublishing.com/oathmark). And even if I do somehow end up playing Middle-Earth with Glorfindel, it shouldn't matter much if he's on the wrong base.
