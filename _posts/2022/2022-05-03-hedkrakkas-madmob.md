Orcs are bullies. We all know this, and yet, it is sometimes nice to paint the bullies, and play as them. Recently I painted up [Hedkrakka's Madmob](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/WHU-Hedkrakkas-Madmob-EN-2021), the Bonesplitterz warband for *Warhammer Underworlds: Direchasm*.

The [Bonesplitterz](https://ageofsigmar.lexicanum.com/wiki/Bonesplitterz) are a super fun faction in Age of Sigmar: orruks who prefer a simpler way of life. They swear off metal armour and weaponry, putting their trust instead in primal magical force to protect them and making weapons from the bones, teeth, horns and claws of the monsters they like to hunt.

Above is Hedkrakka, a Wurrgog Prophet. That means a guy who boogies to make magic happen by pumping up his fellow orcs.

I think I kinda messed up the cloth. I wish it were just orange, rather than such a dark purple in the recesses, but it's ok.

The vibrant green is FW Ink Emerald Green, allowed to run into the grooves around his mask, hand, and staff-head to give the impression of a magical glow.

Here are Hedkrakka's crew:

A characterful bunch. I'm much more satisfied with the colours on these, which is easier to say because they're much simpler models.

Apparently the guy with claws would make a good alternative sculpt for a [Savage Big Boss](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Savage-Orruk-Warboss), although he's on a bigger base. (That's not a deal-breaker in my opinion.)

Maybe I'll do a Bonesplitterz Warcry warband at some point... maybe even a small AoS force... In the short term, I have only two more warbands to go until I've painted all of Direchasm. Onwards and upwards.
