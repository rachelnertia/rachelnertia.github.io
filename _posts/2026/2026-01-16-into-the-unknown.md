Unsure how willing or able I am to comment on the [ongoing matters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w)[^1], I will assume you know what happened at the beginning of this week and therefore understand that it means I am now 100% on the lookout for a new way to make an income.

Hopefully one that will treat me better.

I've updated my [About](/about) page on this site and made posts about job-hunting on social media, including my unhappily-resurrected LinkedIn. A list of potential opportunities is being compiled, leads are being pursued, and one (1) application has been sent.

In the in-between time I have things to keep me busy:

- Model reviews for Goonhammer, like [this one](https://www.goonhammer.com/conquest-weaver-courts-crann-guardians-model-review/) about the Crann Guardians for Conquest's Weaver Courts faction. My plan for today is to finish my review of the [Coill Draic](https://eshop.para-bellum.com/product/weaver-courts-coill-draic/).
- Educational projects and possible portfolio pieces. Recently I've been dipping my toe into [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), a C-like language which has great out-the-box functionality for game dev. It would be great to use this chance to get a game out.

I also need to budget quite aggressively to make sure my savings stretch however long it may take for my incomings to match my outgoings again. I'll be alright though.

And I probably need to get a lodger, a step which is overdue anyway -- it's felt wasteful to live alone in my big flat ever since Nat moved out -- and while Kara and I are hoping to get a place together, that no longer feels likely to happen this year.

Onwards and upwards, I guess.

[^1]: I will at least say that yesterday I attended one of my final Organizing Committee meetings for the union at Rockstar Games. I felt sad, but I also felt hopeful in a way I never have before. The task is in new hands, and they are strong.
