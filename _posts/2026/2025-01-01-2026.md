I'm entering 2026 in a bit of a broken state. 

Two months of stress, bookending an already high-pressure year, have reduced me to a worn-out nub. Too anxious to rest, my sleeps has been fitful and short. My immune system is burned out and I have caught *yet another* cold. I am all aches, pains, blotchy skin and bloodshot eyes.

I don't think I've ever had a December crash quite so complete.

I'm also grieving. I'm grieving what was. I'm grieving what could have been. There is a deep sadness in my heart that will take a long time to pass.

2026 will not be the year I was imagining it would be. Regardless of what happens in court next week I will have to improvise in the months to come. The unknown is scary. 

All I can do now is rest, hope, and fight like hell.

I wish you all the best for 2026.
