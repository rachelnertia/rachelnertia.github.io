**Not *just* a rehash of *Skavenslayer*.**

In 1999's *Skavenslayer*, Gotrek Gurnisson and his human companion Felix worked as "sewer-jacks" in the Imperial city of Nuln, renowned for its artillery school and gunpowder might. There, beneath the city, they uncovered a Skaven plot and, over the course of a series of adventures, foiled it.

In [*Verminslayer*](https://www.blacklibrary.com/all-products/ebook-verminslayer-eng-2025.html), Gotrek Gurnisson finds himself among the "under-jacks" of the Sigmarite city of Greywater Fastness, known for its steampunky technology and industrial power. Beneath the city he finds a new human companion, uncovers a Skaven plot and, over the course of a series of adventures, foils it.

The similarities are deliberate, of course. While I can't deny I'm disappointed in Black Library's reluctance to do anything surprising at all with Gotrek, the nostalgia this novel is steeped in *is* effective on me, and sometimes it's alright to re-tell good old tales. They wouldn't be good old tales, after all, if they weren't worth borrowing from. 

Overall, *Verminslayer* is a perfectly perfunctory fantasy romp through one of the setting's silliest cities. The new companion character is likeable (if a bit mundane compared to Maleneth), the twin Skaven antagonists are great fun, and Jonathan Keeble's audiobook narration is, as ever, brilliant. All his finest rat-man voices come out to speak-play. At the end all I can say is *yes-yes* and, very much so, *more-more*.
