I discovered (or rediscovered?) today that I've lost a lot of my university projects because they were either on Bitbucket[^1] or on a PC hard drive that died in 2020ish, only some of which was backed up. Lost forever now are:

- The GameBoy Advance demos and games I made as part of a first-year module. This included a version of Asteroids and a software 3D renderer.
- Fixed-function OpenGL programming projects. I barely remember these, so I'm curious to see what I came up with.
- Some PlayStation Vita coursework. There were some cool ideas in there, like a 2D platformer where you made bubbles to walk across gaps.
- My fourth-year Honours project, which took an idea I'd experimented with in an earlier module, voxel space rendering using a compute shader, and dived into it in depth.

There's an odd kind of grief here, of nostalgia denied, of the past decomposing from recorded history into fuzzy memory. I'm not sure how to articulate it. I wanted to reflect on who I was before I started working at Rockstar, revisit some old projects, and perhaps mine them for experience, ideas, and resumé material -- but I can't.

Try to back up your stuff, folks. Obviously don't go overboard with it, but you never know what you'll miss when it's gone.

[^1]: I'm not sure when these were purged. If I recall correctly I used SVN (Subversion) or Hg (Mercurial) for version control on most of my projects, and Bitbucket ended support for these at some point in the past 8 or so years, before permanently deleting any remaining repositories that used them. Annoyingly, I can't find *any* emails in my archive about this happening. Did they just do this without warning users directly? I've just learned about the [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) project, which aims to automatically archive any source code repositories that are shared with it. That way, when Bitbucket or GitHub or any other hosting provider executes a purge or eventually dies out, the code will still exist somewhere. I'm glad it exists, even if it can't help me here. I'll try to use it in the future.
