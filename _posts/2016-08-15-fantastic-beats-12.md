It happened to you too, didn't it? It'll be okay. Grab a beverage and relax. Listen to some music you might have missed.

I love CGI Snake. It's this engrossing assembly of looping synthetic pulses. The rest of [the album](http://chriszabriskie.com/divider/) is really nice to relax to, and I heartily recommend checking out [all of Chris Zabriskie's work](http://chriszabriskie.com/index.html). It's the tune that plays in the background in [*Her Story*](http://www.herstorygame.com/), but when I heard it outside that game for the first time I actually thought it was from the first *Mass Effect* game[^1].

Turns out I was misremembering this track:

Looped for ten minutes, it becomes quite trance-inducing.

There's a bunch of really good chilled-out and ambient music in that game, like [the galaxy map music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RO7K4W-c9g). And who could forget [Vigil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IitCQCaKi3E)? It's so... sad? The voice of an extinct species, echoing down the millennia, awe-inspiring, but so full of grief.

Anyway. At the end of the day, sometimes, only a vaporwave compilation will do the trick:

I'll see you next week.
