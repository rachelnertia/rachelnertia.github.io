Today I turned 30. Which feels good, I think?[^1].

A lot of things, good and bad, happened in my 20s. I learned a great deal, but I still seem be growing, developing, changing. Even just in the last year I have experienced so much change! That has been a Lot, sometimes, but it's all going in a good direction. I am very much looking forward to seeing how I continue on my little journey for the next decade, figuring out what I like, doing things, making things, learning things... 

Mostly I'm excited to see how my friendships continue, change, and how new ones come along. How my friends grow and change. Yesterday evening I hosted a party at my flat and was overjoyed to have friends arrive, chat, be merry, and eat my delicious cake. I promise myself lots and lots more of that to come.

Anyway. Yes. 30 years, good!
