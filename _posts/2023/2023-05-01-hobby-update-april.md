From now on I'm going to try writing monthly summaries of my hobby goings-on. It's been a slow month, hobby wise, thanks to being in recovery[^1], sick and/or busy, so there shouldn't be too much to write for this one, I hope.

<!--more-->

I'll have the following sections:

- **In:** Projects I've acquired or started.
- **Out:** Projects I've "finished".
- **In and Out:** Projects for which I've done both of the above.
- **In Progress:** Projects that are chugging along.
- **Games Played**
- **Miscellaneous** loose ends.

### In

**Dreadlord/Sorceress on Black Dragon:** A local was selling one second-hand and I couldn't resist. I have a lot of [dark aelves]({% post_url 2022/2022-04-20-dark-aelves-of-nuloren %}) and this model will make an excellent leader for them. The dragon is built, but only partially painted. For some reason it's on a wrongly-sized base. Only the Dreadlord rider option has been assembled, but I have all the bits to make a Sorceress. Looking forward to getting started on this one soon.

### Out

Nowt.

### In and Out

**Eldar Guardians:** After much encouragement, I finally caved into my desire to paint some Eldar. And so, in the last days of March, I ordered a box of second-hand (but unbuilt) Guardians from Ebay for somewhat less than RRP. As soon as they arrived, on April 1st, I couldn't wait to get stuck into them. I built one of them immediately and painted it up in a test of the colour scheme I wanted to try. 

You don't seem to see many metallic Eldar for whatever reason. I thought it might look cool and it very much does.

It took basically the whole month to paint the squad because I didn't seem to have much hobby time. I hope May is more productive!

### In Progress

**Squig Herd:** 10 squigs and their two herders. Had to commit *hobby crime* to put this unit together, but I was aided and abetted by the victim of the crime, so who's to say if it's a bad thing or not. I got distracted by the Guardians, and should be able to finish them relatively soon.

### Games Played

**Age of Sigmar:** Two games, both 1000 points, finishing up my participation in the Edinburgh and Lothian Gamers AoS league[^2].

The first was against Richard's Kruleboyz, and did not go my way. The second was against Philippe's Nighthaunt, and extremely did not go my way.

**Warcry:** A couple of post-work office games. 

The first was a scenario from the matched play ["Rumble Pack"](https://www.warhammer-community.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/E1PvbyC0742WaOwU.pdf) used at Warhammer World events, which provided a nice symmetrical setup and objectives. I was playing my Horns of Hashut and my opponent was playing Chaos Legionaries, aided by a Slaughterpriest and a Varanguard. Despite being totally outgunned, I was able to win through having more bodies with which to control the board and win VP. 

The second game was a narrative play generated leader-assassination scenario against a high-leveled Seraphon warband. Against all odds I managed to maneuver a single Demolisher through the scrum of lizards and, in one activation, deal exactly enough damage to take the leader, a puny Skink Starpriest, out of action. If he had failed my leader would have died in the following turn. A very tense and exciting match, in which I felt like I was on the back foot right up until I (through sheer luck) won. 

Unfortunately I can't provide photos of office games as we have a strict no-photos-in-the-studio policy :cry:

**Kings of War Ambush:** Jill and I *finally* got together on Sunday 30th for our first 750-point learning games of Kings of War. Turns out it's very fun! My [Ogres]({% post_url 2023/2023-01-16-ogres %}) faced off against her Dwarfs and came out on top in both fights. There's some rules and wrinkles[^3] we didn't quite grasp in the two games we played, but on the whole it seems like a super-streamlined, ultra-speedy ruleset which I can't wait to play more of. We're planning to play at 1000 points next, so I have ordered a [Giant](https://www.manticgames.com/kings-of-war/giant/), who will take up most of the extra points, and should be a fun hobby project.

**Armada:** I played a learning game against Kara[^4] at the beginning of April and another against Jill after our Kings of War session. It's also a fun game, all about planning ahead and outmaneuvering your opponent. I am tempted to pick up some more boats. 

### Miscellaneous

While I was in Games Hub on Sunday I made the shame-free purchase of *Season of War: Thondia*, a very pointless supplement for Age of Sigmar. I have enjoyed leafing through it so far.

[^1]: I had surgery on my neck. I might write about it if I can be arsed.
[^2]: I still need to finish writing my battle report for the 2nd game I played in the 1k league. It's sitting in my drafts, languishing...
[^3]: All the complexity seems to be in how to move units around, which makes sense. That's probably where it should be, in a game that's all about moving units around.
[^4]: Kara didn't like it because it doesn't simulate real Age of Sail battle tactics like [Crossing the T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_T). Fair enough.
