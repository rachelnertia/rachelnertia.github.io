On January 17th I played the 2nd of my 2k league games (the first I wrote about [here]({% post_url 2023/2023-01-16-batrep-elg-aos-2k-league-game-1 %})), this time against Rusty's Kruleboyz.

My army was the same as last time, as we agreed not to use the new points because the app hadn't been updated yet.

His army consisted of:

- Gobsprakk (a powerful named shaman on a vulture who can hurt casters by unbinding their spells)
- A Snatchaboss riding a big sloth
- A mounted Killaboss
- A Killaboss on foot
- A Swampcalla Shaman 
- 3 Boltboyz
- 10 Gutrippaz
- 10 Hobgrots
- Kragnos, the big scary god of destruction

Kind of a Dominion-plus-some-big-toys list, pretty much exactly what I'd do if I expanded my Kruleboyz.

Once again, we played Contest of Generals -- the threadbare, but straightforward, Matched Play battlepack from the Core Book. The battleplan was Burn and Pillage,but neither of us remembered to do any burning or pillaging.

Round 1 was a timid affair, as neither of us really had the movement or the inclination to engage so quickly. We both did a bit of maneuvering. 

I chose the battle tactic where you have to control the centre and snagged it, thinking I would have difficulty scoring it later on and that this might be a good way to lure Kragnos into a position where I could pounce on him with as many units as possible. 

I did not cast any spells, fearing Gobsprakk's horrible unbind ability. Fortunately the spells in my army are nice-to-haves instead of must-haves.

He won priority going into round 2. Kragnos charged the Chainrasps in the centre, instantly killing a few with his impact damage.

Meanwhile, his mounted Killaboss charged the Chainrasps on my right flank.

Kragnos killed a lot of Chainrasps, helped by the fact that Gobsprakk had cast a spell to turn their ward off, but didn't manage to wipe the unit.

The Killaboss, of course, died in a swarm of Chainrasps.

On my turn, I did what I do best with Nighthaunt: charge one thing with the whole army. Turns out if you Stun (-1 to Save) Kragnos like 3 times and Petrify (Strike-last) him, he dies like everything else.

I also moved my Chainrasps up the right side of the battlefield to deal with the Shaman and the Boltboyz, which they summarily did.

I also teleported my Dreadblade Harrow onto the other objective on Rusty's side of the battlefield, capturing it for a battle tactic and more points.

Round 3, Rusy counterpunched with his Snatchaboss and Gutrippaz. They almost wiped the Grimghast Reapers, leaving them on 1 model remaining. The ghosts fought back, with Kurdoss doing a LOT of damage to the Gutrippaz.

Gobsprakk flew back to deal with the Dreadblade, who fought bravely but was pecked to (re-)death by the vulture.

At this point, it was pretty clear the battle was mine. All that remained was to clean up. 

One very funny thing happened: The Snatchaboss redeployed away from me to stand by the gryph-hound statue, making it harder for me to charge him. Kurdoss made his charge, applying Petrify, but had a nasty surprise when it turned out that the statue was one of the terrain features that Rusty had trapped with his Lethal Surprise Dirty Trick. Rusty rolled a 2+. Then Rusty rolled a 6. Kurdoss took nearly all of the 6 mortal wounds, managing to ward off only 1. Then, at the end of the Charge Phase, the Snatchaboss' mount performed a Stomp, dealing D6 damage instead of D3 because of his mount trait. Another 6 mortal wounds. 

Kurdoss discorporated, having been thoroughly humiliated, before even getting to strike a blow.

All in all, a very fun game. The Kruleboyz didn't seem particularly dangerous, and since I managed to neutralize Kragnos early, I had an easy time from then on.

Rusty's paint job on the army is fantastic and I hope I get to play against it again someday. He was also a very fun opponent. We laughed a *lot* at Kurdoss' inglorious demise together.

I shall write about my third battle soon!
