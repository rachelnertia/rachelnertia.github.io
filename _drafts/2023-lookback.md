2023 was a big year for me, with a lot of growth and a lot of grief. 

The early months went quickly. I got ill a few times, so an already-dismal winter became an extra-dismal one in which I was stuck inside a lot. Thankfully I had the date for a long-awaited surgery in late March. With that looming, I had something to look forward to. And also to dread.

Fortunately it went very well and has resulted in a big quality-of-life improvement. I'm intending to write a bit more about it soon because it could be interesting for other people and for myself to reflect upon my experience.

In May I felt stretched thin, and then everything went topsy-turvy in my love life. I won't go into it in detail here, but suffice to say some behavioural patterns I have -- like not being good at saying what I want, or always bottling up anger and discomfort -- had been making things difficult and stressful. Consequently something had to give.

The summer began with a breakup, continued with another breakup, and went on with several months of difficult but rewarding self-reflection, therapy and opening up. I gained a lot of confidence and self-worth, two things I hadn't really realised I lacked. It's still difficult to keep them up and probably always will be, but I'm better equipped than I was. 

I want to stress the difference between knowing something and feeling it, between intellectually understanding something and emotionally getting it, because crossing that chasm was something I had to do a few times this year. You can *think* you are worthy of the things you need and want, but if you keep sacrificing those things at nearly every opportunity, it's clear you don't actually *feel* that way about yourself. You can *think* something that happened was bad without actually letting yourself *feel* how bad it was.

This year I passed the eight-year mark on losing Danielle, with whom I had my first actual relationship. It will not suprise you to learn that her loss had a deep impact on my psychology, and unfortunately healing from such a wound is not just a matter of time. In fact the passage of time seems to have very little to do with it at all. So this year I healed a bit more, not by waiting but by action. I think I have an inkling of what to do next, and I will not let anything get in my way.

Perhaps the biggest emotional switch that flipped in my heart this year was realising I could (and should) feel grief about other things. They may seem less important, but they are not. All shadows are dark and to pretend otherwise is cowardice. 

In the autumn my maternal grandfather died. At 93, he still had all his wits but for a decade had been fighting a losing battle with his ageing body that he couldn't win. I and the rest of his immediate family were able to be with him near the end to say goodbye, for which I am grateful. As a person he was sometimes frustrating -- a trait I have inherited -- but he took a genuine interest in everybody he interacted with. In the days following his death our family received correspondences from all over the world from the hundreds of people who knew him, many of whom were friends he had corresponded regularly with for much of his life. 

He will be greatly missed.

I believe I am entering my 30s with a clearer idea of who I am and what I want from life -- and how to get it -- but really I must accept the likelihood that I am wrong, that I and the conditions around me will change, and that is okay. The challenge is how to adapt to the change. How to make the best of it.
