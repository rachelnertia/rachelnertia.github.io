*A personal milestone: my first ever Space Marines, documented [here]({% post_url 2024/2024-04-11-marines-errant %})*

2024 was a busy year for me in the world of miniature wargaming. I can't write about everything, but there are some things I want to call out before they slide out of memory forever, like posts in main.

## A Fool's Trove in Ulfenkarn

I [wrote about this]({% post_url 2024/2024-02-03-a-fools-trove-in-ulfenkarn %}), so I shant repeat myself here. TL;DR: A day of *Warcry* in January with three other players at my flat.

## Warhammer World

## Age of Sigmar, Fourth Edition

*AoS* has never been this good. There are so many improvements I'd go mad trying to list them all here, from small quality-of-life upgrades like renaming Wounds to Health, to sweeping structural changes like recontextualising things players and models can do as capital-A Abilities. It's a massive step up. The new Spearhead game mode is a great addition, providing both a great entry point to the system and a way to get a quick fix of *AoS* on a busy timetable. 4th Edition has provided me with some of my favourite games of *AoS* already, and I'm keen to give it more opportunities to do so.

The world isn't perfect, of course. I'm still malding about the removal of Beasts of Chaos from the game -- I'm mad at the decision *and* how it was handled. I'm a bit anxious about what will happen to Cities of Sigmar this edition (will my dark aelves be squatted?) and would like answers soon even if they aren't answers I'm gonna like! I find the current iteration of manifestations fun but clunky. Spearhead is great, but there's still a missing link between it and full-fat 2000-point games I'd like to see them build. And I resent the end of free Warscrolls as Battletomes come out. In fact I resent the Battletome model generally and would like to see it evolve into something better rather than another 3 years of churn. 

Anyway. Good game.

## Kings of War

Early in the year I was added to the email chain (boomer communication medium alert!) for a local *KoW* escalation group. I met up with others from the group throughout the year at SESWC (South East Scotland Wargaming Club), returning each time with more Ogres. 

*Kings of War* is my favourite rank and flank game and it'll be difficult for anything to shift it from its place on the podium. So smooth and streamlined are its rules that I can play multiple games of it in one sitting without absolutely frying my brain, which is unusual for a mass battle game. I could definitely be tempted to a competitive *KoW* event.

I didn't reach my goal of 2000 points of Ogres, sadly -- my hobby productivity fell off a cliff in the back half of the year.

## Magewinds Meetup

The reason my hobby productivity fell off a cliff in the back half of the year is that I was preparing for the *Magewinds* Meetup I'd arranged in November, and that was sucking up all my creative time and energy. 

I accomplished a lot, updating the rules, coding a system to automate producing new versions in printable PDF format as well as web format, and (right at the end, in a mad rush) painting up models to use. 

Nonetheless I felt well behind where I wanted to be -- but I have accepted that I always will feel that way about creative projects I embark on in my spare time. I work a full-time job that demands a lot from my brain and, outside of that, have responsibilities and interests that mean I can't devote everything left over to a thing as big as *Magewinds*. I just gotta be happy making do.

And I am, in fact, very happy! The *Magewinds* Meetup was one of my favourite weekends of the year. I wrote about the gaming side of it [on the *Magewinds* blog](mwm), but that post doesn't mention the joy of having my home full of some of my best friends, sharing food with them, and visiting [Marionville Models](marionville) as a big group[^1].

I'm sure I'll have warm fuzzy feelings about the Magewinds Meetup for a long time to come.

## Warhammer Underworlds

I think the design studio at Games Workshop have done a stellar job refreshing *Underworlds*. The rules are greatly improved but still capture my imagination just like they did back when I played it in the Before Times. More importantly it's now a much more accessible product. I mean people can get into it and keep up with it without buying everything. I'm strongly considering getting the local *Underworlds* group back up and running...

## Tiny Plastic People

I continued to appear on the [Tiny Plastic People Podcast](https://shows.acast.com/tinyplasicpeople). It's a privilege to get to ramble about whatever I'm hobbying (and say 'um' a lot).

## Closing Thoughts

This hobby continues to absorb me to such an extent that I doubt I shall ever escape its grasp. I can't complain -- it's rewarded me with creative satisfaction, moments of gaming joy and flourishing friendships. 

Looking back at my hobby plans for 2024, I'm glad
