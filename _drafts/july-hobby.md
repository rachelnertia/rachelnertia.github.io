I feel like I did lots of hobby this month but I don't have much to show for it.

## Games Played: 5

This month I played my first game of the new General's Handbook for Age of Sigmar, and Spearhead. Lots of Spearhead.

The day after we returned from [Arran]({% post_url 2025/2025-07-25-arran %}) I played a practice game against Callum's Seraphon.

It didn't go well. I chose to let him go first and got charged. My stuff died way too fast and it was hard to catch up. But I got to apply my lessons in another game against Seraphon at the tournament the following Sunday.

## Models Finished: 0!

## Acquisitions: 14 (and a bit)

Feeling good about Spiderfang grots, I finally pulled the trigger on ordering 10 more Spider Riders and another Arachnarok Spider.
