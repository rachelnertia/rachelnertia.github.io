I feel like I did lots of hobby this month but I don't have much to show for it.

## Games Played: 5

This month I played AoS Spearhead. Lots of it. The day after I returned from Arran I played a practice game against Callum's Seraphon.

It didn't go well. I chose to let him go first and got charged. My stuff died way too fast and it was hard to catch up. But I got to apply my lessons in another game against Seraphon on Sunday.

## Models Finished: 0!
