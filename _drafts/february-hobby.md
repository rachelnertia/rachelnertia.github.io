Just one post on the blog this month, about my [Kustom Bossrokk]({% post_url 2025/2025-02-23-kustom-bossrokk.md %}).

## Games Played: 5

Warmaster, AoS, Underworlds, Spearhead

## Models Finished: 3?

That's right. Three. I'm very pleased with them, though.

*Three fighters for Magewinds, left to right: a Wizard/Enchanter, a Cleric, and a Guardian.*

The colours came out really nice and rich on those; I feel like I learned something. I'm now painting some more Magewinds fighters.

I'm being dishonest -- I finished more than three models. I'm just not sure about how to count the others, because they're terrain. 

Even more difficult to count are the wood elven buildings I partially repainted, giving them red roofs and lighter walls, making them a lot less monotonous to look at. How should one account for partially-repainted models?
