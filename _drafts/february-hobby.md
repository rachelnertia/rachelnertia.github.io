Here is a belated summary of the hobby activities I got up to in February.

## Posts: 1

Just one post on the blog this month, about my [Kustom Bossrokk]({% post_url 2025/2025-02-23-kustom-bossrokk %}).

## Games Played: 5

I played one 2000 points, General's Handbook game of Age of Sigmar. Battle for the Pass versus a Flesh-Eater Courts featuring both Ushoran and Nagash. This was at Ancient Robot Games. It was good to get my silly Cities army on the table once again, but my Dreadlord (pictured) had a bad time.

*I learned a lot of painful lessons in this game, mostly about how you shouldn't roll high on your command rolls.*

I played a very fun, if brief, game of Warmaster with Tanya. My elves were blasted to death by their Empire cannons and battle wizard while I failed all my command rolls, then a huge brigade of knights cleaned up the other flank. My elves, humiliated and defeated, vowed revenge: there will be a rematch!

I also played some Underworlds in the office. My colleague is gradually gaining confidence at the game. Hopefully soon he will be fully up to speed and kicking my ass.

And two close-fought games of Spearhead at home, both of which came down to a single point. Spearhead is still great.

*My Kruleboyz square off against Mark's Flesh-Eater Courts.*

## Models Finished: 3..?

That's right. Three. I'm very pleased with them, though.

*Three fighters for Magewinds, left to right: a Wizard/Enchanter, a Cleric, and a Guardian.*

The colours came out really nice and rich on those; I feel like I learned something.

I actually finished more than three models. I'm just not sure about how to count the others, because they're terrain. First off, I built, painted and flocked some hills.

I also had a forest's-worth of tiny trees still in their packaging, so I based some of those on 32mm round MDF bases and called them battlefield-ready.

That should be me all set for games of Warmaster, and both hills and trees could be used in larger-scale games too.

Kara printed off some tiny houses and walls which I finally painted up.

The plan is to get more of these, enough for a village, plus some farm buildings and so on. 10mm terrain is very moreish.

All those hills and trees are hard to count as 'models', but even more difficult to count are the wood elven buildings I partially repainted, giving them red roofs and lighter walls. This made them a lot less monotonous to look at. How should one account for partially-repainted models?

## Acquisitions

- **Warmaster Wood Elves**. I placed an order for another 1000-or-so points of models for my Wood Elf army. These have yet to arrive (high demand and print times mean slow delivery), but hopefully soon they shall be on my doorstep. My friend Rich also very kindly printed off some of the models I wasn't able to buy from that commercial printer.
- **Path to Glory: Ravaged Coast**. Narrative gaming rules for Age of Sigmar 4th Edition. Much more interesting-looking than the Path to Glory system from the Core Book. I picked this book up after playing at Ancient Robot Games and excitedly began organising a local group to play a campaign of it.
- **Battletome: Gloomspite Gitz**. Friend Rich didn't need an extra copy of the special version of this book so very kindly sent it my way. It's a good tome, adding some background to the setting and delivering updated faction rules, a few tweaked unit rules, and of course a whole new subfaction (Gitmob). I have some reservations that mean I'm not entirely happy with the faction (hopefully I'll write about these) but, then again, I never was.

## Works in Progress

|      Project       | Number of Models |
| :----------------: | :--------------: |
| Magewinds Fighters |        3         |
|     War Hydra      |        1         |

I'm now painting some more Magewinds Fighters and hoping I will summon the free time to paint that Dark Elf War Hydra for my Cities of Sigmar army. It has been languishing in a drawer for weeks.

See you in less than a month's time for March's hobby progress post ðŸ˜…
