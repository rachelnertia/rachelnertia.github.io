The 4th edition of Age of Sigmar has been out for a while and I've played a bunch of it -- not as much as some, but enough to make up my mind about some things. Here is how I'm currently feeling about the game.

# Definite Improvements

These are changes or additions that are definite wins for the game.

## Health

The Wounds stat is now called Health. It's just so much better. You no longer have to roll To Wound to deal Wounds to a unit and then ask how many Wounds it has "remaining". You now roll To Wound to deal Damage and after that Damage is taken the unit will have a certain amount of Health remaining. Neat.

## Combat Range

Everything is 3" now and it's a delight.

## No Battleshock

It's over. It's so over. The worst phase in the game is gone, and along with it the Bravery stat, which has been replaced with... 

## Control

What was once a background stat (normal models had 1 control, heroes had 2 and monsters had 5, with some abilities increasing or decreasing it) is now foregrounded.

## Abilities

The whole game is now assembled from simple building blocks: abilities. Again this kinda makes explicit something that was implicit and/or muddy in the past.

## Order of Operations

In each phase, the active player uses their abilities. Some abilities are reactions and there's a clear core rule showing exactly when a reaction can be used. After the active player has finished using their abilities for that phase, their opponent can use any "Enemy X Phase" abilities of their own. It's so *neat*!

## Commands

No more fussing with ranges on heroes, generals and totems. The reactive commands are great, and there's no ambiguity about when they can happen. You get 4 Command Points per round and only get more in special circumstances. Due to how great the Command Abilities are, Command Points are a really precious resource you need to guard wisely -- you have to think twice before you use one on All-Out Attack or All-Out Defence.

## Terrain

Terrain is better defined. Also you can no longer have a model half way up a wall.

# Nice Things

These are changes or additions that are improvements but are a bit more fuzzy than the above.

## Modules

## Spearhead

It's a really good game mode. I love it! Each time I'm worried about it getting old I play a match that I come away with thinking about all the things that could have gone differently. The only time I've felt a bit bored was after playing the boring Nighthaunt Spearhead -- it's all infantry, it's a lot of bodies and the rules don't really reflect the full army rules very well.

## Lores

Having to remember which wizard had which spell was cumbersome.

## Prayers

Priests feel meaningfully distinct from wizards now. I haven't played with a Priest yet so I haven't got a feel for whether or not it's annoying to track Prayer Points.

## Battle Tactics

I'm less of a hater on these now. They're all harder, which is a good thing. There are no faction-specific ones, and only 6 universal ones, so the pool of tactics you need to memorize is smaller. I still suffer from decision paralysis -- and subsequent fatigue -- at the beginning of my turns, though.

## Path to Glory

This looks better but I have yet to try it.

# Weird Things

These are changes or additions that I am much less sure about. They don't quite work.

## Manifestations

How do they work?!

## Army Building

The regiment system is a nice idea... but it can create awkward situations when list-building.

Part of the issue is that it means almost every time you take a hero in your army, you're adding a drop. Which is only a problem because we live in a world where the player who finishes deployment first has priority, so they get to decide who takes the first turn, which is still extremely powerful -- in part because of issue #1. So you're incentivised towards low-drop armies, like 1- and 2-drops.

# Issues

These are changes or additions that are definitely misses.

## #1: Double Turn

I'm a long-time double-turn defender. It's dramatic because it's so powerful. You don't get a Battle Tactic -- so what? It may be impossible for you to score a Tactic this round anyway, and having more Tactics to choose from later in the game is an advantage. Breaking your opponent's back at the start of round 2 is still very possible and still very powerful.

## Underdog

This mechanic works well in Spearhead, where it is a bit more balanced. In Spearhead, you need to be several points below your opponent to become underdog. But in GHB you are underdog if you are even a single point below your opponent. In Spearhead, underdog bonuses are randomized from battle round to battle round by which twist card is drawn. In GHB each scenario has a different underdog bonuses, and some of them are really powerful. The underdog mechanic doesn't interact at all with the priority mechanic, so you can get a double turn *and* be underdog.

## Manifestation Spam

You can summon Manifestations in your opponent's turn for 1 Command Point and a contested dice roll. This can be absurdly powerful, far more so than Countercharge.

## Index Design

### Internal Balance

This will always be more important to me than external balance. It doesn't matter to me if my faction can outcompete others if there's only one way of doing it.

For example, Gitz can be really strong -- but only in trogg- and squig-heavy builds. I am here to make sad spider noises as it becomes increasingly obvious my forest goblin collection is all heading Legends-wards.

Another example: Stormcast are really only great when they have plenty of Longstrike (a ridiculously good shooting unit).

Cities are probably in the best place they're ever been (they're my favourite faction index currently) but Steam Tanks (my beloved) are still costed like they can shoot in combat.

### External Balance

Some of the faction indices are just better (stronger *and* better designed) than others.

## Legends

# Missed Opportunities

These are things I wish they'd done.

## Dice Rolling

There's still too much of it.

## Low-Points Games

Spearhead is great but there's still a gap between it and the 2000-point way the game is 'supposed' to be played, and that's a shame.

## Doubles

Doubles is a popular format to play Warhammer in but it's always been up to the community to support it.

## Line of Sight

AoS still uses "true" LOS. We could have been done with it but they kept it in!

# Conclusion

This is the best AoS has been and yet problems still arise from the complex interplay of the parts which make up the game. Can the design team fix these issues and clean up these weird things? And will they continue to improve the game beyond that, or is it all downhill from here?
