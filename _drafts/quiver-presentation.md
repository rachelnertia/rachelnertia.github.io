On December 11th I gave a talk at [C++ Edinburgh](http://cppedinburgh.uk/) about my hobby project game engine, [Quiver](https://github.com/rachelnertia/Quiver). I was barely prepared and kind of blundered my way through it, but the audience seemed to enjoy themselves, and I certainly had fun. Somehow I ran to over 30 minutes, when I thought I had only been going for 10. Time flies! The recording is below.

I made the presentation slides using [React.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1) because I wanted to try using something that's not PowerPoint or Google Slides. It worked, but there's something odd about needing to run a web server in order to present some slides.
