[Kainan's Reapers](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/WH-Underworlds-Kainans-Reapers-EN-2021) are the Ossiarch Bonereapers warband for *Warhammer Underworlds: Direchasm*. I've kind of fallen off *Underworlds*, but I plan on collecting all the warbands from *Direchasm* anyway, because they're all just such cool models[^1].

When I sat down to paint these I didn't really know what kind of colour scheme I wanted to go for. Something simple, I thought, with only a few colours. Something death-themed, with the blues, purples and greens that have made their way onto other undead models I've painted.

In the end, I settled on this purple scheme, with a grey exoskeleton and boney endoskeleton. I like it a lot!

The exoskeleton is Space Wolves Grey, the endoskeleton is Skeleton Horde, and the purple is FW Ink 'Purple Lake'. I wish there was a Citadel purple that was as saturated and juicy.

Here is the big bone boy Kainan himself:

Ossiarch Bonereapers are pretty neat. I knew that already, but now I think it so much I could totally see myself painting more of them. Maybe little a *Warcry* warband, as a treat...

[^1]: I'll probably pick up warbands from subsequent seasons like *Harrowdeep* for the same reason. Additionally, the warbands from *Direchasm* and previous seasons all have rules for use in *Warcry* now, which makes them even more tempting.
