In January I didn't do very much hobby or gaming for a very good reason -- a trip to Paris for non-holiday reasons. I may write about that in another post, because it was quite an experience, but for now I'd like to catch up on some blogging about what I did accomplish creatively in the past month.

## Games Played: 2

I played only two games in January, both in the office. The first was a lunchtime game of Warhammer Underworlds played in the week before I went to Paris and the second was an after-work game of Warcry.

Underworlds continues to entice, so in February I'll see if I can get more games in.

The game of Warcry was fun and reinvigorated my appreciation of the system, but also highlighted how keen I am to see it iterated upon properly by Games Workshop rather than haphazardly supported with ever-increasing amounts of badly-delivered bloat. My opponent was a newcomer to the game and expressed frustration at how dispersed the game's rules are. He had already learned about Divine Blessings (optional paid-for upgrades you can add to your fighters) but not, of course, through any of the game's official materials -- because they were added in a White Dwarf issue -- he just happened to stumble upon them in [Warcrier]([warcrier](https://warcrier.net/))'s Rules section. I find it heartwarming that the game's community has stepped up and produced such a great resource and warband assembly tool[^1], but it makes Games Workshop look bad -- it should be them producing the best rules resources and tools for Warcry, and those should be easy to find for new players thanks to full first-party support. Oh well, we'll see what the year brings in terms of official support for the game.

[^1]: To toot my own horn a bit, I'm proud to say I actually contributed to this effort by producing an early version of the Warcry Fighter Card Creator that Warcrier uses [way back in 2019]({% post_url 2019/2019-12-01-warcry-card-creator %}).

## Models Finished: 7
