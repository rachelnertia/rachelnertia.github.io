The aelf cackles maniacally as she thrusts open the hatch of *Contrivance*'s turret. A rush of cold air from outside hits her and the rest of the tank's crew in the face. For a moment, Agnus blinks, stunned by the sudden chill. 

When Agnus signed up for expeditionary work, he'd imagined himself in a safe, easy job. Perhaps he'd tend to the engine of a mighty, roaming cogfort. Or play with surveying equipment, searching for sources of fuel and rare minerals. He did not imagine he'd ever be in the line of fire himself.

The reality, it turned out, was rather different.

The world snaps back into focus on one thing: Essentricia's downstretched arm, her hand beckoning. Gingerly, Agnus puts the flask of tea in it. He wipes his dripping forehead and turns his attention back to *Contrivance*'s sputtering, shaking engine.

The ambient sounds of battle filtering through the hatch are drowned out by the roar of the steam gun as it rattles back into life. Essentricia continues laughing, her finger on the trigger as boiling death billows forth.

In her other hand, the hot beverage rises.
