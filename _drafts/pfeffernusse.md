I went on a Pfeffern端sse baking spree over the holidays. Pfeffern端sse are German spiced cookies made using the same spice mix as Lebkuchen (i.e. Lebkuchengewerz), with a dollop of icing sugar on top. 

To me, these dumpy wee guys are inseperable from the winter holidays. I just gotta have some, or it just ain't really the Season. I was pretty miffed, therefore, when I couldn't find any in the shops - even in Lidl! 

I was so miffed, in fact, that I decided to try making my own. Here is my own recipe, adapted from [another]() to be dairy- and nut-free, but not completely vegan (sorry!). The ingredients are pretty easy to find in the supermarket, too [^1].

# The Lebkuchengewurz

Ingredients:

 - 1/2 teaspoon star anise.

Grind up the spices what need grinding and mix everything together. There: you have your spice mix. Enough for two batches of cookies.

# The Dough



# The Cookies

In the morning, stick the oven on. 180 degrees Celsius (for a fan-assisted oven). Line a baking tray or two.

Take your dough out of the fridge. Roll it into sausages less than an inch wide, then chop up the sausages into segments less than an inch long. Roll each segment into a ball and pop it on your baking tray.

Once the oven's warmed up, stick the baking tray(s) in. Bake for 15 mins. Remove them and let them cool for about 10 minutes.

To make the icing, get about **300 grams of icing sugar** and mix it with hot water: add one tablespoon of hot water at a time until the right consistency is reached. (The 'right consistency' is your preference, and something you'll need to explore). 

Dip each cookie in the icing so the top of it is well-covered and place it on a rack (so that runny icing can drip through). I use one of the metal racks from my oven, placed above some baking paper for easy cleanup.

After an hour or so, the icing should have hardened. Congratulations! You have made pfeffern端sse. Store them in an airtight container. They should keep for at two weeks - I don't really know, they don't stick around for very long.

[^1]: With one exception: I couldn't find any star anise in Sainsburys. Luckily I found plenty in one of the local Chinese supermarkets.
