For the last year and a bit I've been game master for a long-running *Age of Sigmar: Soulbound* campaign. When I started I chose to create my own custom setting to put my players in, instead of pulling everything from a sourcebook like the official City of Brightspear supplement. Of course, my 'custom setting' isn't so much my own completely original world as it is my own little corner of the Mortal Realms. It may have some of my own flourishes and ideas, but ultimately the rules that govern the Age of Sigmar setting as a whole still apply here.

I thought I'd take some time to write about this shared imaginary place, its people, and what goes on there.

In a far corner of Ghyran, the Realm of Life, there is a city called Nuloren. It is built amongst the roots, trunk and boughs of a collossal tree. The land surrounding Nuloren to the West and South is known as the Vardenfold. It is not all tame, but many free people build their lives in its lush groves and green fields. Just East of the city the Greenwave Gulf opens up, an expanse of jade water that connects Nuloren to the rest of the Realm. Across the Gulf await the wild lands of the Ostenweald, still in great part tainted by the powers of Chaos. Northeast of the city the Gulf tapers into the Firth of Gloom which is then swallowed up by the great dark Gloomwood, a vast and deep forest of sinister spirit. Nuloren is protected from this shadowy place, and the things that dwell in it, by the vast grasslands of the Sunsteppes and the inhospitable Barrier Isles. 

That is the general geography of the place.

The city has many parts. At the base of the tree, man-made fortifications meld with thick roots to create a defensive circle. Twisting in on themselves and riddled with traps,in places these outer ramparts are as confusing and confounding to would-be attackers as a labyrinth. Once these were Nuloren's outer defences, but now they are a thin line between
