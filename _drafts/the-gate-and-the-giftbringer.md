Hobby update! 

Despite me pissing about with some other things[^1], I have managed to finish a couple of projects.

Firstly, the Ophidian Archway. This recently-OOP kit has been catching my eye for years, and when I spotted a built one going for a reasonable price (a bit less than the original RRP, actually) I had to grab it.

[^1]: Firstly breaking down my entire collection of empty sprues into parts that can be used for scratch-building things, and secondly deciding to make *even more* terrain (rocks, mostly) out of my remaining foam.
