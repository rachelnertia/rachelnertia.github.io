Hobby update!

Despite me pissing about with some other things[^1], I have managed to finish a couple of projects.

Firstly, the Ophidian Archway. This recently-OOP kit has been catching my eye for years, and when I spotted a built one going for a reasonable price (a bit less than the original RRP, actually) I had to grab it.

It arrived partially broken and primed black. I reattached the broken part with some glue and milliput (there was a big gap) and put a little bit of extra primer over the top with the airbrush. Then to paint it I did a lot of drybrushing grey colours, made use of my barely-used-these-days Citadel metallic paints for the metal parts, and made light use of some washes (Seraphim Sepia, Agrax Earthshade) to add a bit of colour variation.

I think it came out well and it'll make a great addition to my terrain collection. For future work I might mount it on a base, but I am not sure if I'm super into that idea for terrain I might use across multiple differently-coloured gaming mats/surfaces. If I get a chance to get another cheaply I'll definitely take it as it was a lot of fun to paint and I had all kinda ideas for different colours I could use.

[^1]: Firstly breaking down my entire collection of empty sprues into parts that can be used for scratch-building things, and secondly deciding to make *even more* terrain (rocks, mostly) out of my remaining foam.
