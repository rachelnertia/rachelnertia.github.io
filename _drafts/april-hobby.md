This month contained a trip to [Salute](https://southlondonwarlords.co.uk/what-is-salute) and lots of AoS.

## Games Played: 5

|          Game           | Count |
| :---------------------: | :---: |
|         Warcry          |   1   |
| Kings of War: Champions |   1   |
|      Age of Sigmar      |   3   |

I had another game of Warcry in the office with my Wildercorps Hunters, in which I managed to eke out a jammy victory at the end.

At Salute, Kara and I played a quick demo game of [Kings of War: Champions](https://www.manticgames.com/kings-of-war-champions/), the new Spearhead-equivalent for Mantic's rank-and-flank game. It seems pretty good, but I think I'll hold off on buying any Champions stuff until the Ogre and Trident Realms companies are released. The Ogres because I already have an Ogre army and I'll be able to add the Champions stuff to it, and the Trident Realms because their Champion is a very cute axolotl character.

Back in Edinburgh, I took my Cities army for another whirl against a local's Gloomspite Gitz. After a few hairy moments with Kragnos, my army pulled ahead, and another victory for the Great Tree of Nuloren was won by Essentricia's Tönkbrigäd and the aelven cavaliers. My Wildercorps also had a decent initial outing, doing a bit of shooting and grabbing an objective. It was nice to see some of the new Gitmob models on the table, like the fantastic Doom Diver Catapult.

At the end of the month we had our second Path to Glory day. My spiders fought Mark's lizards and came out on top. Then we quickly homebrew'd a two-versus-one game against the current lead player's Slaves to Darkness army, which is led by a fully-upgraded Anvil of Apotheosis lord who has been the villain of the campaign so far. Combining our might we managed to bring down the beast (finishing him off with a saurus chomp), and while we lost on points we did manage to kill the whole army and each got a good chunk of Emberstone out of it.

I'm thoroughly enjoying Ravaged Coast so far -- it isn't perfect (we're not sure if the fully-upgraded Anvil hero and their Varanguard friends are a fair fight and might have to do some homebrewing to fix that) but if future Narrative Play content for this edition of AoS is this good then it's worth looking forward to. I couldn't ask for a better play group for it either.
