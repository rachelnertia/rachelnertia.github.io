2022 went past in a blur. Here I will attempt to snatch memories out of that blur.

## Flat Get

We bought the flat we've lived in for years (since 2016 for me and since 2018-ish (I think?) for Natalie) from our landlords (a nice couple who live on the other side of the country). 

Kind of an unusual situation, which happened a bit sooner than we really felt ready for it, but it went about as smoothly as it could have gone and by April we were officially the owners. We bought the contents as well because re-buying all the furniture seemed like a dumb idea.

Haven't done much yet to the place yet, but we have:

- Got rid of items of furniture we now could finally get rid of, such as the spare bed.
- Replaced the spare bed with a *huge* fold-out sofa bed courtesy of Nat's parents -- thanks!
- Got rid of the ancient, fire-hazard tumble dryer from one of the cupboards, something the landlords couldn't be bothered to do. This freed up a lot of storage space.
- We have mounted pictures on the walls! What a concept! (Although personally I don't mind and even quite appreciate bare walls.)
- More recently, I have acquired a drill and started putting holes in walls. I needed some coaching from my dad just to get started, but having now put up two wonky shelves, a pegboard, and mounted our router to the wall, my confidence is growing. Even if my skill level isn't.

While there's a lot more I'd like to do, there's nothing urgently *needing* to be done, which is good. The place is in good condition and is already exactly what we need.

I cannot overstate how extremely lucky we are to have been able to do this.

## Forres

Nat and I paid a weekend visit to my aunt who lives near Forres.

## Return to Office

At the beginning of the year, people started slowly being allowed back into the Rockstar North office. In early May it was my turn to return, an opportunity I leapt. Personally I couldn't wait to be back. Being completely rubbish at it, I *hate* working from home. The office is a 15 minute bike ride away, and I enjoy the separation that having a dedicated office outside the home brings. So I've been back to working full-time in the office for most of the year.



## Loch Lomond

## Lisbon

I flew for the first time since 2018.

## JoJo's Bizarre Adventure

This year me and Nat watched the whole of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Somehow we'd both avoided it up until now. Once we started watching, we couldn't really stop, blasting through all the seasons and catching up with the final one just before the last few episodes.

It's genuinely great.
