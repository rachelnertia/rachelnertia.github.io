Rollmodels Roll Out got off to a flying start with a 1k point game of AoS, pitting my Stormcast Eternals against Rich's Nighthaunt. We decided to play Relocation Orb, and needed a model to represent the mobile objective, so I picked a boar I'd brought with me. Hence *Relocation Pig*! I don't remember all the details of what happened, but I recall the broad strokes and between us we took quite a few photos, so here is a piecing together of what went down.

Rich's ghosts are absolutely gorgeous, as you can see from the photos. Perfect combination of paint and base schemes. He has quite a filled-out collection, too, and it's all produced at an incredible standard. (Between you and me, I'm rather jealous.)

## Deployment

## Round 1

I can't remember who won the first roll-off, but I took the starting turn. In this scenario, there is a single objective that must be captured to score points. You capture it by having more models within 3" of it than your opponent, with wizards and artefact-carrying heroes counting for 20 models. The twist? The objective moves at the end of every round in a semi-predictable fashion, and you score more points if you take the second turn in a round and manage to capture it.

The pig started in the middle, so I got on top of it as quickly as I could. My Lord-Relictor used Translocation to plop the nearby unit of Liberators in a line in front of it. 

Meanwhile, my Skinks spread out to the left in an attempt to screen my rear and flank. Nighthaunt can deploy units who're waiting in the underworld outside of 9" from an enemy unit, the same way Stormcast can, so it was also an attempt to keep Rich from bringing down his reserves too close to any of my more important units. 

Turn 1 ended with me scoring a point.

At the end of the round, the pig moved towards me and to the left, almost on top of Rich's Hexwraiths. I needed to clear them away and block him from getting any other units on top of it. 

## Round 2

I went first.

Turn 1 ended with another point for me.

## Round 3

I went first.

Turn 1 ended with a third point for me.


Turn 2 ended with Rich *just* capturing the objective, earning him 3 points. *Eek!* 

## Round 4

Turn 1 ended with me earning my fourth point.

The pig bounced far away to the right, almost out of reach for me but just reachable by his remaining Chainrasps.

At this point, Rich had 6 points and I had 4. The best I could hope for was a draw, provided I won the roll off and went second. It all came down to the next roll off.

## Round 5

... which I lost. However, Rich thought it'd be entertaining to let me go second anyway.

The Skinks, meanwhile, knocked the final two wounds off of his wizard with their boltspitters.

## Aftermath

Thoughts: The whole time, I was really unwilling to take the second turn. Despite the increased award, I just didn't feel like I had the maneuevrability, smashing power and numbers needed to wrestle control of already-captured objectives from the ghosts. Consequently, I was always on the defensive.

My first big mistake was bringing down the Retributors where I did, with no hero/general within range to even allow them to reroll their failed charge. They managed to get a lot of work done despite this (they are absolute killing machines given the opportunity), but the battle would have gone my way if I had been able to get them where they were needed faster. In fact, it might have been better to have them on the objective in the first turn instead of the Liberators because they would have utterly destroyed the Chainrasp Horde which became a game-winner in the later rounds. I dunno!

The only thing I feel really unlucky about was rolling all those 1s for my Lord-Celestant's saves. That was a real bummer.

All in all, one of my favourite games of AoS yet. I'm really getting the hang of my army and how the game works, and it was a good introduction to Nighthaunt. Thanks to Rich for being such a fine opponent!
