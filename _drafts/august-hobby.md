August. Perfidious August. In August, Edinburgh goes mad. I go mad with it, and either go along with it or try to escape from it. This year I attempted a half-hearted escape, attending very few Fringe shows but not leaving the city entirely. I could have spent a lot more time hobbying, but instead I spent most of two whole weekends working on Magewinds. I'll talk about that after talking about what I did manage to get done hobby-wise.

## Games Played: 1

It's hard to get everyone together for anything in the summer months. Consequently Path to Glory day was delayed til the last day of August following a hiatus, and we mustered only three people for it. (Ed did drop by briefly following his triathlon though, which was nice!)

## Models Finished: 10

## Acquisitions: 2

Lord Aquilor, Treelord

In the same batch of Hachette orders I was also expecting to get the parts I needed to build a third Gargant, but I was BETRAYED and MISLED into purchasing the wrong issue so I now have *even more* spare giant parts. Great.

## Works in Progress: 12

Spiders

## Magewinds
