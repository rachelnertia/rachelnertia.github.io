Lately I've been painting up some classic Middle-Earth elves, starting with some archers:

And some blade-wielding warriors:

These models are like ur-Warhammer, to me, being among the first Games Workshop kits I ever saw and laid hands on.  These particular models may in fact be the very same ones I got in that Warriors of the Last Alliance box, sometime back in 2001 or whenever. Some of them, at least - I think a good few of them were Katamari'd up from other places, such as Nat's parents' attic.

I admire their simple elegance.

I also managed to acquire some of the ones with spears and shields second-hand. I even purchased a blister of 3 of the current finecast versions available for sale on the GW website. I don't completely regret that purchasing decision, but *oh lord* were the metal ones better to work with. 

I also bought the High Elf Command blister. Thankfully these two guys are still made in metal.

Finally I painted up the mounted Glorfindel I've had for many years. I painted the on-foot version that came in the same blister a couple of years ago, but in a different colour scheme. Maybe I'll go back and repaint him to match?

He's on a rectangular base instead of the circular one he's meant to go on because, ultimately, I'm planning to use these models to play Oathmark with. And even if I do somehow end up playing Middle-Earth with Glorfindel, it shouldn't matter much if he's on the wrong base.
