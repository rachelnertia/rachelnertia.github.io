I said I was interested in Civilization V back when it was announced.

When it came out, I had an interesting time with it. It certainly does make some worthwhile and appreciated changes to the Civilization formula. It is, however, still Civ. Diet Coke may require a slightly different recipe from normal Coke, but it still tastes more or less like Coke. Unlike Coke, Civilization does not keep me awake.
