Hell Year 2020.2 (AKA 2021) is almost over. The year formally known as '2022' is about to begin. Time to look back over the year's abject triumphs and majestic failures in my hobby life. (My hobby, in case you're unaware, is painting and playing with little models.) 
It's been a busy one. I've been stuck at home a lot, so it's not surprising I've had a lot of time for painting.
