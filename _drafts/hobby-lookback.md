Hell Year 2020.2 (AKA 2021) is almost over, and the year formally known as '2022' is about to begin. Time to look back over the year's abject triumphs and majestic failures in my hobby life. (My hobby, in case you're unaware, is painting and playing with little models.) 

It's been a busy year. I've been stuck at home a lot, so it's not surprising I've had a lot of time for building and painting.

## How I Hobby

I've been doing this for, what, 4 years now? So I'm pretty established in what I do and how I do it.

## Goblins

## Nighthaunt

## Cursed City

## Malign Sorcery

## Dominion

## The RMRO Army

## The RMRO Itself

## Project Magewinds

## Loose Ends
