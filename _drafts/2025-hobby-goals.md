I'm keeping my aspirations modest, as there are some probable releases this year that may grab my focus:

- [Gitmob Grots](https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/vab9rzvn/world-championship-preview-the-gitmob-prepare-to-race-across-the-mortal-realms/) for *Age of Sigmar*. These are confirmed for early this year, and will be hard to resist. I was a big fan of [Rippa's Snarlfangs]({% post_url 2020/2020-02-16-rippas-snarlfangs %}), the *Warhammer Underworlds: Beastgrave* warband that heralded this release way back in 2020. I'm less of a fan of the new models being included in the Gloomspite Gitz faction, as I feel that there's a bit of a thematic gulf between these sun-worshipping *Mad Max* grots and the troglodytic Bad Moon lovers, but if it's done well then I'll be on board with it. 
- *Warcry* 3rd edition. This is just a hopeful prediction but it seems likely as it will have been 3 years since the last edition and the game has suffered a bit of a release drought of late. I've played the heck out of *Warcry* over the last 6 years so if a new version (and its accompanying big box) arrives I will be very excited!

Mostly I hope to just follow the butterfly this year, as I'm happiest and most productive when I'm just between different things without feeling like I have a responsibility to paint anything in particular. That aside, these are the things I think I can commit to:

- [ ] Review the [Weaver Courts](https://www.para-bellum.com/the-weaver-courts/) model range for [Goonhammer](https://www.goonhammer.com/).
  - This long-awaited *Conquest* faction may finally arrive this year. [Bair](https://www.goonhammer.com/author/bair/) asked a while ago if I'd be up for writing about the new kits as they come out and I eagerly agreed -- I've been hyped about these extraterrestrial wood elves who fleshmeld with wild creatures ever since I first learned about them. I hope I like them, regardless of whether or not they match up with the way they look in my imagination.
- [ ] Grow my *Kings of War* Ogre army to over 2000 points. 
  - Most *KoW* events seem to be held at or above 2000 points, and it would be nice to be able to attend one.
  - It's currently sitting just below 1500 points. I was planning to reach 2000 points in 2024, as I was participating in a local escalation group, but Ogres were one of the many casualties of my hobby output dropping dramatically in the back half of the year. 
- [ ] Start a 2nd *Kings of War* army so I can do demo games. 
  - The question is: *which one?* At present I'm leaning towards Halflings, but Forces of the Abyss are cute too... 
- [ ] Grow my *Warmaster* Wood Elf army to over 2000 points.
  - It's about time I played some full-size games of this silly old system. It won't take long to paint all the units I need to reach my target, as the models are very small. I just need to bite the bullet and place an order with a 3D printing place.
- [ ] Scratch-build a fantasy tower out of a Pringles tube.
  - This is just one of those 'bucket list' king of things I gotta do before I die. 
- [ ] Upload one hobby blog post each month of the year.

Beyond those well-defined goals, I have other aspirations: 

- Continue building up my Cities of Sigmar army.
- Ditto for Gloomspite Gitz.

I'd also like to play a lot this year:

- [ ] Play 12 non-Spearhead games of *Age of Sigmar*.
- [ ] Play 6 Spearhead games of *Age of Sigmar*.
- [ ] Play 6 games of *Kings of War*.
- [ ] Play 6 games of *Warhammer Underworlds*.
- [ ] Play 6 games of *Magewinds*.

Finally, I'd really like to continue improving *Magewinds*, so I'll figure out what I reckon I can achieve on it this year soon.
