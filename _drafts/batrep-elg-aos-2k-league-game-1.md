I bit the bullet and entered this year's [Edinburgh and Lothian Gamers]() Age of Sigmar league -- twice, in fact, because there are two leagues, one for full-fat 2000-point armies and one for 1000-point armies. I entered the 2k league with my Nighthaunt and the 1k league with my Cities of Sigmar[^1]. Both leagues are intended as fairly casual affairs, aimed more at getting some games in than determining who is the best Sigmar in Edinburgh.

The leagues are divided up into groups, and each person in a group has to play every other person in that group by the end (of April, I think?). There are 4 other people in both my groups, so I have to play 8 games total. Which is quite a lot, given how I normally only play about one game of AoS a month! 

With a sense of urgency I got my first game arranged as soon as I could.





One game down, seven to go!

[^1]: Perhaps this will be the last hurrah for my current Cities collection, before the new book (slated to come out some time this year), comes along and -- presumably -- completely reworks the faction.
