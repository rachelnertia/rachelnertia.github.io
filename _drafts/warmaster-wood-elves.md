[*Warmaster*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warmaster) was one of several short-lived Games Workshop systems released during its late-90s-mid-2000s *Lord of the Rings*-license boom era. It depicted 10mm-scale armies fighting grand-scale battles in the *Warhammer Fantasy* Old World setting and, like many of its contemporaries ([*Epic*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_(game)), [*Mordheim*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordheim)...), its appeal has long outlived its official rules and models support, which crawled along for over a decade before rattling its death in the early 2010s. Nowadays the game is kept alive by a devoted community of fans playing and developing the unofficial [*Warmaster Revolution*](https://www.wm-revolution.com/) ruleset, buying/selling/trading old official models, and creating new unofficial models and even whole new unofficial armies through the wonders of 3D printing. 

One such whole new army is Wood Elves, who never had rules in the original ruleset or any of its infrequent official expansions. Lore-wise, they don't really seem suited to the kind of warfare *Warmaster* aims to represent: they are guerrilla fighters, ferociously defending their woodland enclaves but rarely venturing beyond them in numbers. Nonetheless they are a well-developed and popular force in the Old World setting and embody a classic fantasy trope, so it was inevitable someone would make rules for them in *Warmaster Revolution*, and even more inevitable that someone would make beautiful STLs (3D printer files) to represent them.

My Wood Elves are prints of the STLs designed by Forest Dragon Miniatures.

The majority of them were printed in April but it took a while for them to make their way onto my painting desk and an equally-long while for them to make their way off it. Nevertheless, finally, they are ready for battle!

TODO: Units

All I had to pay for this army was a small contribution to the cost of the resin used, the 40x20mm bases from Warbases, and the cost of paints and other materials, which I already owned. Did I mention the rules are free, too?

Even if I add another 1000 points to this army, it'll still fit in a shoebox. So all in all I would consider *Warmaster* to be quite an accessible wargame, as it is both cost and space efficient.

That's all for now. I shall soon find out how *Warmaster* in general and this specific army plays on the table, and report back!
