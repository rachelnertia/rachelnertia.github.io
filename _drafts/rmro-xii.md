Last weekend I went to Walsall for yet another lovely weekend of socialising and miniature wargaming with the Discord hobby community I am a part of, Rollmodels[^1]. This time we descended upon an old favourite, [Board In Brum](), although this was my first time at their current location. It remains a great destination for wargaming, with many tables, shedloads of terrain, a well-stocked shop and a crowd of friendly regulars.

Saturday morning began with a hard landing in the world of *Warmaster* as Kara and I finally played our first 1000-point game. Yes, we travelled hundreds of miles to play a game with each other we could have played at home. We wanted it to be an exhibition match of sorts, to entice others into the warm *Warmaster* waters. 

After some scrambling for appropriately-scaled terrain, we got down to business.

I had done some preparation by having watched some [tutorial videos]() and reading the rulebook on the journey down. It wasn't enough. While it does get crunchy in the combat phase, *Warmaster* is not a particularly complicated ruleset -- the problem is that every single rule is buried in paragraph upon paragraph of text, written in the most conversational and meandering way possible. This is to be expected from a game written in the early 2000s, but I hoped the *Warmaster Revolution* team had simplified the text a bit. There are helpful "at a glance" sections at the beginning of each chapter, but they usually elide many key details. Details you must then go digging for in the bloated chapter itself. 

Fortunately, Drew was on hand with a print-out of the *Warmaster Revolution* rulebook[^2], which made searching for rules much easier. He also brought with him his own understanding of the rules, which was far more developed than ours, so was able to chime in at key moments and answer our questions. Once she'd thoroughly crushed my Wood Elves, Kara took on his Chaos Dwarfs in a 1,500-point battle.

I came away from my first game bamboozled and tired, itching to play something simpler or which I at least understood better, but nonetheless I am excited to try more *Warmaster*. I have planned my next 500 points of Wood Elves.

John printed out and painted a set of the super-cool [Blade Pit Arena]() terrain by Dark Fantastic Mills so he could run a special game of *Warcry*. The first bout had 6 players and took a surprisingly long time, but remained dramatic throughout and was exciting to watch.
