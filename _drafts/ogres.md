I've been wanting to try Mantic Games' flagship rank-and-flank wargame Kings of War for several years, and the tail months of 2022 presented the best opportunity to do so I'd had so far thanks to a convergence of factors:

- Ambush
- Found a local opponent
- New hard plastic ogres, appearing in the Sands of Ahmun starter set, which I split with a friend.

These 13 models come to a total of 675 points.

We decided to aim for 750 points for our first battle, so I had 75 points to play with. There are only 4 options in the Ogre list that fit in that little space:

1. An Army Standard, which sounds cool but I'd have to do some kitbashing and possibly even sculpting :grimacing: (70 points)
2. A Red Goblin Biggit, a goblin hero (55 points)
3. A Red Goblin Blaster, a cart full of explosives (65 points)
4. A regiment of Red Goblin Rabble (75 points exactly)

Number 4 was my choice -- I've wanted to paint some of Mantic's (relatively new) hard plastic goblins since they were released, and this gave me an opportunity to paint a whole unit of them. While it would have been nice to paint another character or a cool weird thing like the Blaster, the army really needs more units than it needs toys.

I haven't started the goblins yet, apart from having built one of them. I'll get to them very soon though, so stay tuned!
