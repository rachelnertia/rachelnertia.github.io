Every Christmas season in the Rollmodels community we have a Secret Santa. This year my santee was my good friend Rich. I had no ideas for what to give him until late November, when all of a sudden I connected three things: 

1. That Rich is an Orruk Warclans enjoyer.
2. That the preview for the upcoming (now released) Orruk Warclans update included a terrain piece. (Since then the terrain piece has been [released](https://www.warhammer.com/en-GB/shop/orruk-warclans-bossrokk-tower-2025).)[^1]
3. That I like to scratch-build terrain and wanted more practice. 
 
[^1]: I forgot that Rich would probably be reviewing the Orruk Warclans update for Goonhammer -- [which indeed he was](#gh) -- and therefore I wouldn't be saving him any money. Oh well. He has two towers now. And one of them is **unique**.

The synthesis of these 3 facts was obvious: I should build my own take on the new Orruk Warclans terrain piece and gift it to Rich!

Going into this project I had no idea how to begin building this thing, so I asked various folks for suggestions and settled on a mixture of DAS clay, XPS foam and balsa wood. I began by cutting three lengths of balsa wood, one long enough to poke out the top of the tower's head and the other two short enough to support it. I then used a stanley knife to shave the wood, creating an impression that these were trees that had their bark removed by orruk axes. These became the tower's poles.

I began by creating a big ball of tin foil around the long pole, near it's top.

When Rich paints it up I shall share his photos here.
