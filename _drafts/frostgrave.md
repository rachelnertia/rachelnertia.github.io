Tabletop wargaming can be a lot of fun. Very *fuzzy* fun. Where in a videogame nearly every move you make, every interaction with the other players, can be unambiguous and clear-cut, the same just isn't true when you're measuring inches and moving oddly-shaped minis over the surface of a table. The minis fall over, and when they get back up they've slid an extra few millimetres. Even the buildings your soldiers weave between and climb on top of aren't very solid - they jitter slightly from turn to turn as they are accidentaly nudged by the players. 

Some designers attempt to tame this madness. To be viable competitive games, they must stamp out any ambiguity about rules. The fuzz must be stripped off to leave a wargame that is slick and streamlined, or so fractally complex that it requires computer-like memory and processing power to execute the rules, and a puritanical attitude between players who police each other's play and punish every infraction.

Other designers aren't trying to make a competitive game. Players who are more interested in the simpler pleasures of miniature wargaming -- the storytelling, the social contact, the consensual back-and-forth, the *trust* -- will be best served by games that embrace fuzz. Games like *Frostgrave*.

*Frostgrave* is a gaming system published in 2015 by Osprey Publishing and authored by Joseph McCullough. It's done pretty well for itself in the harsh world of miniature wargaming, awarded with an ever-expanding range of official miniatures and numerous expansions and even tie-in novels. I can confirm that the miniatures are pretty decent, but I've yet to read any of the tie-in novels. At least tie-in novels mean you've made it, even if they're rubbish.

Over the last half-year or so I've been [getting into the hobby]({% post_url 2016/2017-11-21-the-hobby %}) of miniatures painting and gaming as a kind of escape (perhaps even an exodus) from videogames. It's been quite a journey and it's led me and a friend into the icy ruins of *Frostgrave*.

The basic idea is that each player is a wizard who is trying to get rich and/or powerful by looting the remnants of an ancient city. The wizards are not alone, as each brings a warband of hired soldiers with them and possibly also an apprentice, who functions as a sort of less-good version of the wizard. Each game of *Frostgrave* involves competing over some treasure scattered across the gaming table while neutral monsters close in and mess stuff up.

It took us a few games to get the rules down but that's because we're idiots, not because they're hard to grasp. That said, there are times when the rules for certain spells or situations could be more clearly worded, and we had to resort to searching forums for answers or coming up with little house-rules. Which is fine! As I mentioned, *Frostgrave* is a fuzzy game, and that means coming up with house rules. 

Now that we've played a dozen games or so it plays quickly and dynamically. Neither player is waiting for long before they get to make a move or at least roll a die because each round of play has control switching back and forth between players. It's smarter than a simple I-go-you-go system, moving from Wizard Phase, in which the players take turns to activate their wizards, to Apprentice Phase, in which the same happens but for apprentices (a good reason to take one with you), to Soldier Phase, in which they take turns to activate their remaining soldiers. Wizards and apprentices may activate soldiers near them too, allowing you to do more and act faster in their phases, rather than having to wait until the Soldier Phase. Unit activations are short and sweet, too: you move and/or do an action like attack or cast a spell, and that's it.

Of note is the 'swingy-ness' of the system. It's played with twenty-sided dice, and the way damage is calculated means it's possible to get really badly hurt in one hit. For example, if I fail combat against you because you rolled a 19 + your Fight stat of 2 = 21 and I only rolled a 8 + my Fight stat of 1 = 9, the amount of damage I take is 21 - my Armour of 10 = 11 points of damage! Which is often enough to put a soldier out of action. There's an optional critical hit rule where rolling a 20 results in double damage, but I'm not sure why you'd ever need to play using it -- getting hit on a 20 already hurts like hell.

Entering combat puts your own combatant at risk as they may lose the combat and take damage. Ranged attacks are terrifying -- being out in the open where an enemy archer has line-of-sight to you is hugely risky. We learned pretty quickly that the game map should never have long firing lines.

All these factors make *Frostgrave* a game about trying to avoid danger as much as possible while adapting to sudden dramatic changes in circumstance. The icy ruins are a scary place to be! So don't go in expecting to do well by executing a perfectly-laid plan. It may go very much awry.

I haven't even talked about spellcasting yet!
