Tabletop wargaming can be a lot of fun. Very *fuzzy* fun. Where in a videogame nearly every move you make, every interaction with the other players, can be unambiguous and clear-cut, the same just isn't true when you're measuring inches and moving oddly-shaped minis over the surface of a table. The minis fall over, and when they get back up they've slid an extra few millimetres. Even the buildings your soldiers weave between and climb on top of aren't very solid - they jitter slightly from turn to turn as they are accidentaly nudged by the players. 

Some designers attempt to tame this madness. To be viable competitive games, they must stamp out any ambiguity about rules. The fuzz must be stripped off to leave a wargame that is slick and streamlined, or so fractally complex that it requires computer-like memory and processing power to execute the rules, and a puritanical attitude between players who police each other's play and punish every infraction.

Other designers aren't trying to make a competitive game. Players who are more interested in simply enjoying the fun parts of wargaming -- the storytelling, the social contact, the consensual back-and-forth, the *trust* -- will be best served by a game that embraces fuzz. Like *Frostgrave*.
