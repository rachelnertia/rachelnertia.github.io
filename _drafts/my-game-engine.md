This blog post is about programming a game engine in your spare time while working full-time as a programmer in the AAA game industry, why you probably shouldn't, and why maybe you should.

...

I think the reasons I keep coming back are (in no particular order):

- It's quite constrained. I'm not trying to make my own alternative to Unity. The things I'm trying to do haven't really been done before.
- It's a great way to learn.
- It's a bit therapeutic. 
- The dream is: I will use this to make cool games I will like and others will like. And maybe others will also use it to make things. That dream isn't showing any signs of dying, so it remains a source of motivation.
- Programming is inherently satisfying for me. Strangely enough this is true even when I am having a bad time of it. There is something very engaging for me about the process of iteration from rough concept in my head, to code, to a solution to a problem. It's self-expression. Craftsmanship. And my brain feeds off it.
