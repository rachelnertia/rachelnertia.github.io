This blog post is about programming a game engine in your spare time while working full-time as a programmer in the AAA game industry, why you probably shouldn't, and why maybe you should.

I've been making a game engine in my spare time for over a year now, giving it at least a couple hours each week. It all started when I had a few weeks of free time and the idea for a particular game bubbled to the surface of the cauldron of things I wanted to work on. That game required its own engine, and gradually that engine grew into what I'm now calling 'Quiver'.

...

I think the reasons I keep coming back are (in no particular order):

- It's quite constrained. I'm not trying to make my own alternative to Unity. The things I'm trying to do haven't really been done before. Quiver has its own unique approach to rendering that limits the range of possible things you can make with it. If I wasn't trying to carve out a niche, didn't have these artificial limits, I'd probably have given up on the project by now because it was too big and too pointless.
- It's a great way to learn and do things I don't get to do at work. Quiver is a C++14 project that uses standard library components whenever possible. I get to use the latest language/library features and try out libraries I like the look of, like nlohmann::json and spdlog. I get to write graphics code and input-handling code and game logic. I get to build my own weird version of an Entity-Component System.
- It's a bit therapeutic. After a long day of trying to navigate the massive work codebase, spending a bit of time with code that's just mine can be refreshing. There's no coding styles I don't like, no patterns I disagree with. Things are just the way I like them. It's like tending to my own little walled code-garden.
- The dream is: I will use this to make cool games I will like and others will like. And maybe others will also use it to make things. That dream isn't showing any signs of dying, so it remains a source of motivation. I am brimming with ideas for things I'd like to make with it, but I can't do properly until the engine has a few more features.
- Programming is inherently satisfying for me. Strangely enough this often remains true even when I am having a bad time of it. There is something very engaging for me about the process of iteration from rough concept in my head, to research, to code, to working solution. The constant balancing of trade-offs. It's self-expression. Craftsmanship. And my brain feeds off it.
