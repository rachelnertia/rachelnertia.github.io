This blog post is about programming a game engine in your spare time while working full-time as a programmer in the AAA game industry, why you probably shouldn't, and why maybe you should.

I think the reasons I persist are, in no particular order:

- Programming is inherently satisfying for me. This applies, strangely enough, even when I am having a bad time of it. There is something very engaging for me about the process of iteration from rough concept in my head, to code, to a solution to a problem. It's self-expression. Craftsmanship. And my brain feeds off it.
