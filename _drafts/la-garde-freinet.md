I just returned from a week in the south of France, staying in a townhouse in a village called La Garde Freinet. The village is situated in the hills about San Tropez.

I've been there a few times before but this was my first visit in roughly five years, and this time I brought Natalie. It was good to be back! In many ways the village is the same, but it has changed in some ways, and in October it has a rather different feel than it does in high summer.

The region is densely forested. The hills surrounding the village are low enough to be covered in a rich fuzz of foliage. Autumn hasn't quite arrived yet and everything is lush and verdant, if a little on the dry side of things. Descending onto the plains to the north and south the forest remains, giving way only to roads, groves, villages and vineyards. Big umbrella pines tower over smaller deciduous trees, bushes and shrubs. The earth is the colour of rust, visible between blades of dry, brittle grass.

None of the people are pale-skinned. You are either a shade of brown, or pink.

The region is a historic producer of silk, chestnuts and cork. The latter two it still exports. Along the edges of paths one can find trees that have been stripped naked of all their bark up to about head height.

The Rhone valley is known for its 'Mistral' wind that occasionally blasts down from the north.

We visited the Gorges du Verdon. Condors. Autumn colours. Cool views from the pedalo.

That village with the chapel.
