title: We can Premake it if we try

Recently week I started using Premake in Quarrel, my game/engine spare-time project.

Premake is a tool that generates project/make files for different build systems, including Visual Studio and gmake.  

At the end of all this, I have 3 projects in my solution/workspace:

- Box2D, a static library
- QuarrelLib, a static library, which contains all the engine code
- Quarrel, an executable

At the very least, Premake made it pretty easy to reorganize things, and for that I am pleased.
