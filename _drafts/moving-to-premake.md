title: We can Premake it if we try

This week I started using Premake in Quarrel, my game/engine spare-time project, and took the opportunity to generally reorganise some things.

At the end of all this, I have 3 projects in my solution/workspace:

- Box2D, a static library
- QuarrelLib, a static library, which contains all the engine code
- Quarrel, an executable

At the very least, Premake made it pretty easy to reorganize things, and for that I am pleased.
