title: Age of Sigmar 4th Edition Wish List

On the whole I've been quite disappointed by *Age of Sigmar*'s third edition. Luckily, Summer 2024 will see the three-year edition cycle inexorably continue, so why not put together my own little list of things I'd like to see?

I understand that 4th edition is probably already finished and on its way to printers. I am not naive enough to believe that my preferences would be taken into account anyway. This is a fun exercise though.

Here are my wishes, in order of increasing unlikelihood:

## 1. Streamline and Simplify

*Warhammer 40k* had its 10th edition this year and I'm generally pretty happy about the direction the designers took with it. I'd like to see a similar direction taken with AoS' 4th. Even if that means invalidating everyone's hard-won battletomes and entering a world of index-hammer[^1]. 

Ditch Heroic Actions and Monstrous Actions. Both of these are cruft as far as I am concerned. If you want to make heroes and monsters more impactful, buff their stats and/or give them more special abilities on their warscroll. If you must keep them, streamline them so that you roll to see if you can do one *before* choosing one to do. Nothing feels worse than prevaricating for a full minute over which Action to do and then failing it.

Also ditch most weapon options.

## 2. Refactor Stormcast

This faction has too many units.

If there is *one* addition to Stormcast I would like to see it would be...

## 3. A Gryph-hound Hero Model

I just think it would be cute!

## 4. Matched Play v. Tournament Play

Also, while we're here, can we have an equivalent of Combat Patrol? In general I would like to see lower points levels get the support that 2000-point games do.

## 6. Path to Glory

I like the idea but not the implementation. Maybe it just isn't for me, but doing lots of paperwork after a battle isn't my ideal way to complete a session of my limited gaming time.

## 7. More Unnamed Characters

Please just make a non-unique/non-special version of every character warscroll so my little narrative heart will be happy.

## 7. Ditch the Wound Roll

I would have brought this up in the first section because that is where it rightly belongs, but it is so unlikely that it has to go in its own category.

[^1]: I quite like index-hammer anyway because it is very accessible.
