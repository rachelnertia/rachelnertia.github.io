On Wednesday 8th March I played my second 1k game of the league against Sam, who I'd played [previously]({% post_url 2023/2023-02-25-batrep-elg-aos-2k-league-game-3 %}) in the 2k league. This time he was playing Fyreslayers.

## Round 3

## Round 4

## Round 5

In my turn my Bleakswords finally made it to within 1" the right hand enemy objective, so at the end of my turn I was able to score 2 points for holding 2 objectives, and then pillage the objective for D3 points... and I rolled a 3, equalizing me with Sam's 18 points! I would have scored Repel if I'd rolled (slightly) hotter on my quicksilver swords and wiped out his Hearthguard, but alas. We'd both completed our Grand Strategies, so the game was a perfect draw.

Oddly satisfying.
