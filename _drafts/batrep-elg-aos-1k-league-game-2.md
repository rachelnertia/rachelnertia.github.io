> Aetra's keen eyes focused on the icy mist to the North, watching as stout shapes emerged from it, steam hissing from where their feet touched upon the snow. The Fyreslayers had arrived, as expected, with revenge in mind. Debts were owed, and the duardin were not forgiving creditors. It didn't matter how obvious it had been that the forces of Nuloren had no intention of coughing up the vast sums of gold the warrior lodge had demanded as payment for their services. The duardin may have been fools, but they were committed fools. You had to respect that. 
> 
> It was up to Aetra and her underlings to stop them catching up with the rest of the Nuloren host. *Always do the least favourable tasks fall upon us Darkling Covens*, she thought bitterly, thinking of the rest of the army already making its way into the warmer climes in the South. *But perhaps that is because we are so good at them?*
>
> Rising out of the mist came the great hulking shape of a Magmadroth, flames curling from its lashing tail, the scaly ridges of its back, its roaring maw. Atop it rode a duardin of apparent importance. Aetra snorted at the smouldering scowl he sported beneath his ridiculously-large orange crest, which wobbled from side to side as his mount moved. Yet at the same time, she felt a wave of trepidation pass through the ranks of all her aelven soldiers, to whom she was telepathically linked. She frowned with distaste, focused on the fear with her mind, and snuffed it out. As one, the Bleakswords, Black Guard and Drakespawn Knights under her command snapped to attention, ready to give their lives without question.
>
> She made eye contact with her supporting Sorceress, Ilioth. "Are you ready?" 
>
> Ilioth grinned with sharpened teeth. "For killing self-important mercenaries with no loyalty other than to gold? I am *always* ready."

On Wednesday 8th March I played my second 1k game of the league against Sam, who I'd played [previously]({% post_url 2023/2023-02-25-batrep-elg-aos-2k-league-game-3 %}) in the 2k league. This time he was playing Fyreslayers.

## The Armies

My army was the same as last time.

Sam's Fyreslayers consisted of:

- An Auric Runefather on Magmadroth
- A Battlesmith
- 10 Vulkite Berzerkers
- 10 Hearthguard Berzerkers

Not very many models, but it turns out they can take, and dish out, quite a beating.

## Deployment

I deployed my Sorceresses and their Black Guard on the left objective, with the Drakespawn Knights screening them. On the right objective I placed my two units of Bleakswords. My Shadow Warriors went in reserve.

Sam placed his Vulkite Berzerkers on the right-hand objective and everything else on the left.

## Round 4

Sam took the first turn and, at the end of his hero phase, the Swords finished off the Magmadroth. The Sorceress didn't have much time to enjoy her triumph, however, as she was prompty surrounded by the Hearthguard and splatted into nothingness.

The Shades continued there protracted battle with the Vulkites, until they too eventually died. It's a shame they didn't get to pillage the objective.

## Round 5

In my turn my Bleakswords finally made it to within 1" the right hand enemy objective, so at the end of my turn I was able to score 2 points for holding 2 objectives, and then pillage the objective for D3 points... and I rolled a 3, equalizing me with Sam's 18 points! I would have scored Repel if I'd rolled (slightly) hotter on my quicksilver swords and wiped out his Hearthguard, but alas. We'd both completed our Grand Strategies, so the game was a perfect draw.

Oddly satisfying.
