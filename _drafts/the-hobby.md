Reader, I paint lizards.

I paint them at the weekend. I paint them on weekday evenings. Sometimes, I even paint them before going to work. Painting lizards is my new, fantastic pastime.

It's not really a new interest, but a revived one. Painting miniatures and playing with them has drawn my attention since I was a teenager, but it was only recently that I excavated my old Warhammer models from the eeves in my mum's old house. Then I realised that I wanted to get (back) into painting models and maybe even playing with them. Conveniently, many of my old models were either unpainted or painted so poorly that it almost seems cruel not to repaint them.

I've improved over the months and began buying new tools and fresh supplies.
