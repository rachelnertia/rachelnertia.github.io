Reader, I paint lizards.

I paint them at the weekend. I paint them on weekday evenings. Sometimes I even paint them before going to work. Painting lizards is my new, fantastic, engrossing pastime.

It's not really a new interest, but a revived one. The world of miniatures has drawn my attention since I was little, but I drifted away in my mid-teens. In the last few years, spurred on by the likes of the Miniatures Monthly podcast and Hipsterhammer blog, I realised I wanted to try it again, this time with an adult's patience and disposable income. 

So I dug my old Warhammer models out of the eeves in my mum's house, shone a light on them, dusted them off, and surveyed what I found: a wasteland. Many are unpainted; others painted so poorly that it almost seems cruel not to repaint them. Perfect. Plenty of fertile ground for practicing on.

Painting is a mindful activity. It takes focus and the kind of continuous, careful thought process that is at once exhausting and intensely relaxing. I always emerge from painting sessions feeling energized, but calm and collected, as if the activity has opened my head up and replaced some faulty wiring. 

Since I picked the brushes back up I've improved measurably. That's another part I enjoy -- observing my skill and know-how grow, and feeling my confidence increase as a result. 

I am beginning to buy new tools and fresh supplies.
