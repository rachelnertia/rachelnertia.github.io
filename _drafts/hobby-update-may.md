### In:

- Kruleboyz Beast-skewer Killbow, from Stormbringer magazine
- Kruleboyz Man-skewer Boltboyz x3, from Stormbringer magazine
- 6 Squigs, which will let me assemble another Squig Herd, from a friend
- Also from the same friend, an unbuilt Loonboss, an unbuilt Mangler Squig, a built Gobbapalooza, a built unit of Fanatics, and an unbuilt unit of Fanatics. Goblins galore!

### In/Out:

- A Kings of War Giant, to bring my Ogre army to slightly under 1000 points. I am ready for my next encounter with Jess' Dwarfs!

### Out:

- Black Dragon

### In Progress:

- I finally started repainting the bases on my old Stormcast, beginning with my Lord Celestant.
- I did the same for this Dreadlord, whose base did not match the rest of my Cities units. The plan for him is to be a unit leader for a squad of Drakespawn Knights.
