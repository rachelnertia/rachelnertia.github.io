I was planning to attend a *Kill Team: Badab War* event at the end of February, and in spite of my herculean efforts to swallow my anti-Space Marine pride and assemble a warband, I caught covid and couldn't attend. Which sucked! 

Nonetheless, by the time I realised I wasn't going to make it I had already done all the hobby I needed to do, producing eight Space Marines of the Marines Errant chapter, fresh and shiny and ready to wage civil war.

*Kill Team: Badab War* is a fan-made modification (module? supplement? hack?) for *Kill Team* based on the Badab War: a historical conflict in the Warhammer 40,000 setting in which various Space Marine chapters went to war with each other over taxes. It is available as a PDF in which there are special rules for assembling Space Marine kill teams from the various chapters who took part. 

Once I had decided I wanted to attend the meetup I forced myself to choose a chapter and settled upon the Marines Errant, who appealed because they are sailors (hello) and can make use of xenotech (alien weaponry).

I was lucky to be given sprues for Mark VI marines by my friend Pete (AKA Fiyenyaa). I have a soft spot for beaky Marines, so that was a great start. After that, I bought bases and bits from eBay, chose Fafnir Rann to convert into my Void War Veteran (a specialist available to the Marines Errant), and sourced some Eldar bits from my own bits box.

*A Breacher with an Eldar fusion gun, which counts as a slightly better melta gun which can explode and hurt the user. It may seem non-codex compliant at first glance, but there is a purity seal so that makes it okay.*

I got to stretch my kitbashing, conversion and sculpting muscles on this project.

Maybe one day I will get to play *Kill Team: Badab War* with them as intended.
