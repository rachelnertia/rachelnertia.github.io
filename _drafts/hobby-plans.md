## Dark Aelves

Next weekend I am hosting a *Warcry* event! A very small one.

## Space Marines

In late February I am attending a little meetup where we will be playing Kill Team using the rules from a fan-made Badab War supplement.

## Kings of War

Having played a few games of *Kings of War* I'm convinced I like it and want to invest more into it.Luckily we have a little grow league starting up here in Edinburgh, starting at 750 points in February and working our way up to 2000 points by July. 

I already have 1000 points of Ogres, so the question is not how to start but how to continue. I think I'll grab some of the very characterful hero models and paint up a unit of Siegebreakers: heavily armoured ogres who will make a great anvil for the rest of the army to smite things upon. That can be my next few hundred points, and will let me run a few different lists at the lower point levels.

## Loonshrine

I am now a proud owner of the frequently out-of-stock Gloomspite Gitz terrain piece, and so I must paint it! This is also giving me some motivation to work on more of my Gitz backlog (and get more Gitz)
