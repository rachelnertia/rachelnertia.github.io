## Project Magewinds

*Magewinds* is the working title for a super-small, super-tight skirmish ruleset I've been working on in 2021 - although really it's the culmination of ideas I've been prototyping and playing with for several years.

It's sort of like a cheapskate version of *Warhammer Underworlds*. Each player has 4 or 5 miniatures of their own choosing, representing very distinct fighter classes, and they duke it out on a tiny battlefield. Combat is speedy, punchy and interactive. There's also nifty magic system. I am increasingly pleased with it, but I need to get back on the development horse after I fell off it when life got busy in late Autumn.

In some form or another, I *will* ship this game in 2022! I will kick my ass into gear and get it out the door! And while I'm doing that, I'll build and paint a bunch of warbands for it...

## Terrain

It's been a while since I made or painted any terrain/scenery. In 2021 I did a little bit of terrain work, but none of it was very ambitious: I improved the paintjob on my TTCombat MDF buildings, painted some gnarly dead trees from Mantic, and painted the various doors, bridges and objects from Warcry: Catacombs. That was about it. Pitiful!

I *started* painting my Warhammer Fortress in 2021, which was ambitious, but only finished two pieces of it because I can't be bothered going outside to spray things. I'll definitely get it done in 2022. My aim is to construct some supporting pieces of scratch-built scenery to go with it once it's done: things like steps, ladders, maybe even rubble and whole collapsed sections.

Other bits of terrain I want to try this year:

- Big LOS-blocking rocks, a little bit grassy to go with my grassy gaming mat.
- Large LOS-blocking rocks and ice blocks to go with my frosty gaming mat.
- Modular stone platforms, appropriate for Frostgrave, that can be used to raise bits of the ruined city above the rest. Stairs to go with them.
- Things made from leftover sprue: barricades, ladders,walkways... Very excited to try this.
- I have some unbuilt Azyrite ruins (the defiled kind you get from Warcry) that I acquired via Mortal Realms magazine and Catacombs. Plan for these is to build some taller buildings out of them than what I currently have.
- Graveyard things, probably a bit frosty. I have a *lot* of Garden of Morr bits (like the Fortress, courtesy of Elaine...) to do something with. Might be cool to try to build some large LOS-blocking or stand-on-able pieces with tombs integrated into them...

As you can see, I have much to do in the world of terrain!

## Oathmark

I have a yearning in my soul for a rank-and-flank game, though I couldn't tell you why. It's just... emotionally appealing to me: big blocks of infantry, marching, wheeling, flanking, charging. 

While I'm deeply curious about several games in this subgenre, like *Kings of War* or *The Old World* (whenever that arrives), it looks like Osprey Games' *Oathmark* is the best fit for me right now. It's miniatures-agnostic, lets you get creative with mixed-species kingdoms, all the (relatively simple) rules come in one thin and aesthetically-pleasing book, and it's designed by good old Joseph McCullough of *Frostgrave* fame. Most importantly of all, a friend of mine has already painted up part of an army for it, so there's a chance I might actually get to play it some day.

Anyway, to play *Oathmark* I'll need an army, which in my case will be a big mixture of various models I've acquired cheaply over the years: *Lord of the Rings* elves and men, old Warhammer Fantasy dwarves, elves, goblins... a whole bunch of random crap, some of which can do double-duty in my Cities of Sigmar army for *Age of Sigmar*. I'll also need to pick up some new things for this project, like maybe a dragon? I've got to have a dragon, right?    

## Whatever I'm Tempted to Purchase

It goes without saying that A) I will buy or acquire new things to paint in 2022, and B) I will try to paint the things I already have before buying new things to paint in 2022. Every hobbyist makes this pact with themselves every new year. (Usually I fail, sob.)

This year will probably actually be different because we're buying the flat we live in right at the beginning of it, which will take all the money, and any money left over should be put towards the home improvement projects we can finally do once we own the place. After fixing and upgrading things, I'll be trying to rebuild my savings and probably putting them towards other very important things. In conclusion, I'll be thinking more carefully about hobby purchases.

Nonetheless, there will be things that I wanna get. Games Workshop will continue to shovel out amazing things, and so will other companies. And there are already items on my wishlist I'd like to pick up: the new Red Harvest boxset for *Warcry*, for example. Or the last two Direchasm warbands, which I want to have in my collection even though I don't plan on playing *Underworlds* in the future? And that *Oathmark* army's going to require some purchases... 

I'll only feel bad if I acquire more than I paint. No sweat.

## Onwards and Upwards

One last thing I want to hold myself to is to document my hobby better. Take nicer photos of WIPs and finished models, write more blog posts, that kind of thing. I've been really falling behind on that side of things, usually because I'm so hyped to start the next thing that I don't want to pause to write about the last thing. I'll try. We'll see.
