## Terrain

It's been a while since I made or painted any terrain/scenery. In 2021 I did a little bit of terrain work, but none of it was very ambitious: I improved the paintjob on my TTCombat MDF buildings, painted some gnarly dead trees from Mantic, and painted the various doors, bridges and objects from Warcry: Catacombs. That was about it!

I *started* painting my Warhammer Fortress in 2021, which was ambitious, but only finished two pieces of it because I can't be bothered going outside to spray things. I'll definitely get it done in 2022. My aim is to construct some supporting pieces of scratch-built scenery to go with it once it's done: things like steps, ladders, maybe even rubble and whole collapsed sections.

Other bits of terrain I want to try this year:

- Big LOS-blocking rocks, a little bit grassy to go with my grassy gaming mat.
- Large LOS-blocking rocks and ice blocks to go with my frosty gaming mat.
- Modular stone platforms, appropriate for Frostgrave, that can be used to raise bits of the ruined city above the rest. Stairs to go with them.
- Things made from leftover sprue: barricades, ladders,walkways... Very excited to try this.
- I have some unbuilt Azyrite ruins (the defiled kind you get from Warcry) that I acquired via Mortal Realms magazine and Catacombs. Plan for these is to build some taller buildings out of them than what I currently have.
- Graveyard things, probably a bit frosty. I have a *lot* of Garden of Morr bits (like the Fortress, courtesy of Elaine...) to do something with. Might be cool to try to build some large LOS-blocking or stand-on-able pieces with tombs integrated into them...

As you can see, I have much to do in the world of terrain!

## Project Magewinds

*Magewinds* is the working title for the super-small, super-tight skirmish ruleset I've been working on in 2021. 

I will ship this game in 2022! I will kick my ass into gear and get it out the door!
