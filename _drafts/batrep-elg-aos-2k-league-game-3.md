## The Armies

This time, the points changes had made it to the app, so I updated my list. Some Nighthaunt units had dropped in points, so I was able to swap out the Shyish Reaper a different endless spell: the Mortalis Terminexus, a big floaty hourglass. This turned out to be a good swap!

My opponent's army was what I consider to be an archetypical Slaves to Darkness force: ranks of big, bad, heavily armoured dudes.
