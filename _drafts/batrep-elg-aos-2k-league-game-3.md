On February 1st (help, I am very bad at writing these reports in a timely fashion) I played another game of AoS at Red Dice Games in Leith, this time against Sam and his Slaves to Darkness.

## The Armies

This time, the points changes had made it to the app, so I updated my list. Some Nighthaunt units had dropped in points, so I was able to swap out the Shyish Reaper a different endless spell: the Mortalis Terminexus, a big floaty hourglass. This turned out to be a good swap!

My opponent's army was what I consider to be an archetypical Slaves to Darkness force: ranks of big, bad, heavily armoured dudes.

- 10 Chosen (Mark of Nurgle)
- 10 Chaos Knights (Mark of Slaanesh)
- 2x10 Chaos Warriors
- 3 Ogroid Theridons
- Sorceror Lord
- Chaos Lord on Foot
- Chaos Lord on Horse 

Everything was in one big Battle Regiment.

## Round 1

I got to curse a whole 4 units, so I chose his heroes and the Chosen. 

Out-dropping me, Sam made me take the first turn. I immediately yeeted the Mortalis Terminexus at him, although the distance was too great for it to do anything this turn. I think it might have been close enough to apply a mortal wound or two to the Chaos Warriors, but I think they blocked it with their special shields.

Following that, I advanced my army up into my usual death-star-battleline, ready to weather a charge.

Unsure quite what to do with them, I deployed my Grimghast Reapers behind a bit of terrain on the right-hand side of the battlefield. I was still unsure about them in my first turn, so they remained there, safe and ready to charge anything that moved onto the objective.

In Sam's turn, the Terminexus hopped over the Chaos Warriors and splashed out some mortal wounds onto several units. It's a good little endless spell.

He was really hindered by the terrain bottlenecking him into his deployment area, but managed to get his Knights out and make a somewhat wonky charge. The closer unit of Chaos Warriors charged in as well, while the other unit took the right-hand objective.
