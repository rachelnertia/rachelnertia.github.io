I have a "gravel bike" now, which is a kind of fat road bike that can tackle more difficult terrain but without being a mountain bike. I am not a bike taxonomist, so I cannot describe the subtle differences between types of bike any more than I can distinguish most electronic music genres. I just have to trust the experts, who say: it is a gravel bike.

I still have my old bike, which is a "hybrid", but not really, but sort of (my mechanic says it doesn't know what it wants to be), and I plan to keep it. Therefore I am in the novel and enviable position of owning two bicycles, one for commuting and nipping about town (the old one) and one for Adventures (the new one).

The bike I got is an Argon 18 Grey Matter. I tried a few different bikes while shopping around and it was the first that immediately felt like it fit me. Fortuitously it was also reduced by Â£1000 and I was able to buy it via my company's Cycle to Work scheme, making it affordable. 

I'm still getting used to it but I like it a lot and soon I shall be going on Adventures.
