*The Signal from Tölva* is a pseudo-sequel to developer Big Robot's previous (2014-ish) game, *Sir/Madam, You Are Being Hunted*, and it's difficult to speak about *Signal* without referencing *Sir*. They have a lot in common: theme, inspirations, design principles, mechanics, shared code, and 'feel'.

In the world of *Sir*, humans are pursued across moody rural and post-industrial landscapes by aristocratic robots and their mechanical hounds. It's like modern Tory Britain, but more pleasant.

*Tölva* looks very different. At some point in its past it was trashed when the debris from countless wars were dumped on its surface, but it's difficult to tell if there was anything much there to be trashed. Rocks, maybe, and some small lifeforms clinging on to them. Now robotic soldiers wage war over the remaining spoils, the drones of three factions locked in a remote-controlled war, looking for something. That's where you come in.

You're hacking into one of the faction's network of drones, hijacking them so you can explore the planet and discover more about the titular Signal.

In *Sir* combat was something to be avoided, a frantic and frustrating last resort that usually ended with you bleeding or dead. Here things are different. The price of death is low -- you just hijack a new robot body to inhabit at any strategic point controlled by your faction -- but that doesn't mean charging headlong into the fray is a valid strategy. Battles are methodical, with a high time-to-kill and tension loaded into the long reload times on all the weapons and cool-down timers on the shields and area-of-effect powers. Enemy and allied robots all use the same set of weapons and tools as you, so you'll never be confronted with something you yourself can't bring into battle. I learned to begin engagements by hitting every member of the enemy squad once so they'd activate their shields. By the time I'd fired my first shot at the last one, the first's shield would be about to run out of juice, and I'd be free to focus all my fire on that individual.

Then there's the fantastically named SQ-UID Phreaker, a 'gun' that lets you command robots from your own faction and have a wee squad of them follow you around the map.
