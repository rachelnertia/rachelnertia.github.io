*The Signal from Tölva* is a game about robots. It has a lot in common with Big Robot's previous game, *Sir, You Are Being Hunted*, a first-person stealth-em-up that takes place in a procedurally-generated pastiche of the English countryside. In the world of *Sir*, humans are pursued across bleak rural and post-industrial landscapes by aristocratic robots and their mechanical hounds. It's like modern Tory Britain, but more pleasant.

*Tölva* looks very different. At some point in its past the debris from countless wars crashed onto its surface, but it's difficult to tell if there was much there beforehand. Rocks, maybe, and some small lifeforms clinging on to them. Now the drones of three warring factions fight over the remaining spoils in a remote-controlled war, searching for something. That's where you come in.

You're hacking into one of the faction's network of drones, hijacking them so you can explore the planet and discover more about the titular Signal. And that's where the mandatory story stops, giving you freedom to ignore the rest completely or seek it out.

In *Sir* combat was something to be avoided, a frantic and frustrating last resort that usually ended with you bleeding or dead. Here things are different. The price of death is low -- you just hijack a new robot body to inhabit at any strategic point controlled by your faction -- but that doesn't mean charging headlong into the fray is a valid strategy. Battles are methodical, with a high time-to-kill and tension loaded into the long reload times on all the weapons and cool-down timers on the shields and area-of-effect powers. Enemy and allied robots all use the same set of weapons and tools as you, so you'll never be confronted with something you yourself can't bring into battle. I learned to begin engagements by hitting every member of the enemy squad once so they'd activate their shields. By the time I'd fired my first shot at the last one, the first's shield would be about to run out of juice, and I'd be free to focus all my fire on that individual.

Then there's the fantastically named SQ-UID Phreaker, a 'gun' that lets you command robots from your own faction and have a wee squad of them follow you around the map.

Progression mechanics are of the sort people are probably used to from mainstream open world games. Completing missions unlocks new weapons and powers, while the resources needed to purchase them must be salvaged from wreckages and by killing enemies. There's not a lot of variety in the range of weapons on offer -- there are five main archetypes (including the hacking gun), and the arsenal is filled up with tiers of them and minor variations.
