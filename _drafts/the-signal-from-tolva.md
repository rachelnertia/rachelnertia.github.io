*The Signal from Tölva* is a game about robots. It has a lot in common with Big Robot's previous game, *Sir, You Are Being Hunted*, a first-person stealth-em-up that takes place in a procedurally-generated pastiche of the English countryside. In the world of *Sir*, humans are pursued across bleak rural and post-industrial landscapes by aristocratic robots and their mechanical hounds. It's like modern Tory Britain, but more pleasant.

*Tölva* looks very different. At some point in its past the debris from countless wars crashed onto its surface, but it's difficult to tell if there was much there beforehand. Rocks, maybe, and some small lifeforms clinging on to them. Now the drones of three warring factions fight over the remaining spoils in a remote-controlled war, searching for something. That's where you come in.

You're hacking into one of the faction's network of drones, hijacking them so you can explore the planet and discover more about the titular Signal. And that's where the mandatory story stops, giving you freedom to ignore the rest completely or actively seek it out, which is what I did.

Most of what you do is walk and look at things. Just the experience of traversing Tölva's scarred hills and rock and rubble-strewn valleys is a remarkably intense one. There are moments of silence and stillness when you scan the distance for threats and watch some of the planet's wildlife glide across the sky. Then the sounds of a distant battle breaks the silence, shockwaves echoing off the stones, and the austere synths of the game's [soundtrack](https://forcesofgood.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-the-signal-from-t-lva) give momentum to your hike. Entering one of the map's numerous strange places, your vision and hearing become warped and glitchy, sometimes fantastically so, and you begin to feel like you're manning a [deep-sea exploration drone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSfESqX-E84&ab_channel=JasonTaylor).

Everything is styled after the concept art of Ian McQue, and it genuinely feels as if you are walking through one of his paintings that's been brought to life. It's so eminently screenshot-able that picking out shots to use for this post from among the hundred-or-so I amassed in my playthrough was quite a challenge. I love it.

I also love Big Robot's approach to accomplishing this remarkable feat. In one video and accompanying blog post the developers discussed how they deconstructed McQue's style, identifying the components of his 'visual vocabulary' and using them to construct a dictionary from which to could build art assets, and then a world. That kind of craftsmanship is on display all over *The Signal from Tölva*. I think the game is a fine example of how a small team of savvy and skilled-up individuals can come together to create impressive work. I recommend reading back over the blog posts they've written about their various processes over on their blog.

Eventually you will have to fight. In *Sir* combat was something to be avoided, a frantic and frustrating last resort that usually ended with you bleeding or dead. Here things are different. The price of death is low -- you just hijack a new robot body to inhabit at any strategic point controlled by your faction -- but that doesn't mean charging headlong into the fray is a valid strategy. Battles are methodical, with a high time-to-kill and tension loaded into the long reload times on all the weapons and cool-down timers on the shields and area-of-effect powers. Enemy and allied robots all use the same set of weapons and tools as you, so you'll never be confronted with something you yourself can't bring into battle. I learned to begin engagements by hitting every member of the enemy squad once so they'd activate their shields. By the time I'd fired my first shot at the last one, the first's shield would be about to run out of juice, and I'd be free to focus all my fire on that individual.

Then there's the fantastically named 'SQ-UID Phreaker', a 'gun' that lets you command robots from your own faction. You have limited control here: you can tell them to follow you or move to a particular location, but not as individuals. You can control your own loadout, and all robots in the game use items of weaponry and utility from the same arsenal as you, but you can't customize the loadout of your squad members. If you want to build the perfect team, you'll have to assemble it by luck.

Progression mechanics are of the sort people are probably used to from mainstream open world games, albeit smaller in scope than AAA games tend to offer. Completing missions unlocks new weapons and powers, while the resources needed to purchase them must be salvaged from wreckages and by killing enemies. There's not a lot of variety in [the range of weapons](/images/the-signal-from-tolva/tolva_arsenal.jpg) on offer -- there are five main archetypes (including the hacking gun), and the arsenal is filled up with minor variations and versions of them at different tiers of effectiveness.

## Bots Behaving Badly

The planet seems to be waking up, or perhaps just turning over in its sleep. It is a character of its own. Like the irradiated and alien Zone from the *Stalker* games, it is at best indifferent to your presence, when it is not actively hostile.

It seems to be a graveyard for much older things than the crashed war machines that litter its surface, while the robot soldiers are locked into a cycle of automatic violence.

It is difficult to figure out what's going on and why because the scraps of information you find about the world you're in are brief and sparse. What you do uncover as the game goes on is eldritch, unsettling; it's cosmic horror for the information age. If I ever do understand quite what *The Signal from Tölva* is about, it will have taken me a while to reach those conclusions.

There's a [free expansion](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/05/25/the-signal-from-tolva-free-expansion-announced/) arriving sometime soon and I expect I'll use that as a reason to revisit Tölva. I can't wait to go back.
