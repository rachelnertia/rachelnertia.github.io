*The Signal from Tölva* is a pseudo-sequel to developer Big Robot's previous (2014-ish) game, *Sir/Madam, You Are Being Hunted*, and it's difficult to speak about *Signal* without referencing *Sir*. They have a lot in common: theme, inspirations, design principles, mechanics, shared code, and 'feel'.

In the world of *Sir*, humans are pursued across moody rural and post-industrial landscapes by aristocratic robots and their mechanical hounds. It's like modern Tory Britain.

*Tölva* looks very different. At some point in its past it was trashed when the debris from countless wars were dumped on its surface, but it's difficult to tell if there was anything much there to be trashed. Rocks, maybe, and some small lifeforms clinging on to them. Now robotic soldiers wage war over the remaining spoils, the drones of three factions locked in a remote-controlled war, looking for something. That's where you come in.

You're hacking into one of the faction's network of drones, hijacking them so you can explore the planet and discover more about the titular Signal.
