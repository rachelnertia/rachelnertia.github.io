## Goals and Resolutions

### Game a Week

I want to play one game per week -- on average. It can be a game of anything, as long as it meets the incredibly vague definition of "miniature wargame".

I'm at 3 already! One game of Age of Sigmar and two of Frostgrave. Let's go!

### Kings of War

### Terrain

## Events/Leagues

Hopefully the trend of playing Warcry in the office after-hours will continue.

For the first few months of the year I'll be participating in the Edinburgh and Lothian Gamers *Age of Sigmar* league, getting lots of games in.

At the end of February we're having a mini-RMRO at Knightly Games in Bathgate, a whole two days of gaming.
