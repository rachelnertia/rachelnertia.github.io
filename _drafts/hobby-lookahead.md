## Goals and Resolutions

### Game a Week

I want to play one game per week -- on average. It can be a game of anything, as long as it meets the incredibly vague definition of "miniature wargame".

I'm at 3 already! One game of Age of Sigmar and two of Frostgrave. Let's go!

### Kings of War

### Terrain

## Events/Leagues

Hopefully the trend of playing Warcry in the office after-hours will continue.

For the first few months of the year I'll be participating in the Edinburgh and Lothian Gamers *Age of Sigmar* league, getting lots of games in.

At the end of February we're having a mini-RMRO at Knightly Games in Bathgate, a whole two days of gaming. 

## Upcoming Releases

### Stormbringer

Oh no. Another Warhammer partworks magazine. I am so fucked. 

You see, the previous one, which ran from late 2019 through 2020, was stuffed full of Stormcast and Nighthaunt. It was also possible to pick up single issues via Forbidden Planet. This made for the most affordable way to collect Age of Sigmar models probably ever. I would not have a Nighthaunt army without it!
