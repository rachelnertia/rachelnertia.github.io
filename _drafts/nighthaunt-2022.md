The Nighthaunt are one of Games Workshop's made-for-*Age of Sigmar* model ranges[^1], released at the very beginning of the 2nd edition of the game. They were given some pretty cool rules intended to make them feel like a liquid swarm of ghosts:

- They could all fly. In *Age of Sigmar*, this also has the effect of letting you pass through walls freely.
- **Ethereal** meant they couldn't be affected by Rend. This worked by making their armour save unmodifiable, so it was a double-edged sword.
- Like all Death armies, they had a 6+ ward if they stayed near a hero, for a bit of extra durability.
- Like other Death armies, they had easy access to ways to heal models and return them from the dead. After all, how do you kill that which has no life?
- They could deploy half their army off-table and then deep-strike with them later in the game, in the exact same manner as Stormcast Eternals.
- Finally, they had a strange ability called **Wave of Terror**,

These were a reasonable straightforward set of army and unit rules that, by and large, fit the theme - but they were rather weak, both in pure competitive terms and in flavour terms. Four years have passed since 2018's Nighthaunt launch with only a few light-touch updates and tweaks. It's been a long wait for more interesting, potent rules for ghostly armies in *Age of Sigmar*, but it's been worth it.
