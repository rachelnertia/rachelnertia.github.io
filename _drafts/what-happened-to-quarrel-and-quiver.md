You know how I was working on that pseudo-3d game engine, [Quiver](https://github.com/rachelnertia/Quiver)? That I was so well stuck into that I even did a [presentation]({% post_url 2018/2018-01-10-quiver-presentation %}) about it? A whole year and a half ago? Well, it may be no surprise... but it ain't really happening any more.

Making stuff in your personal time is a big challenge. You're at the mercy of:

- Your dwindling energy levels when working in the margins of a day's work or a busy weekend day.
- The cruel march of time. It can be so hard to find enough, and even if you can, can you find the long, unbroken stretches of time you need to really get things done?
- Your own whims. As your enthusiasm for an existing project dwindles, new interests take flight. And you'd be a fool not to pursue them, really. Life is short.

The last thing I did on Quiver was very satisfying, however. All I did was break apart the game, Quarrel, from the engine, so that it now lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/rachelnertia/Quarrel). While I'm not sure I'll ever return to Quarrel, I'm still attached to the idea of returning to the engine and seeing what else I can do with it, or expanding it a little[^1]. This separation will make that return easier.

It's past time for me to finally say farewell, then, at least for now. Bye-bye little project!
