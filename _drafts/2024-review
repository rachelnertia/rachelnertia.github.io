I find it useful to write about a past year as it comes to an end or, in this case, as a new one begins. I haven't done a lot of blogging this year so it is particularly useful now, allowing me to sort my memories a bit and get out of the discombobulated funk I find myself in. What did I do in 2024? How am I feeling about it?

As I wrote this, sections ballooned into posts of their own, such as this one about getting a new bike and riding it a lot:

TODO: Link to 2024 in Cycling. 

TODO: Link to Hobby Year.

TODO: Link to Music of 2024.

All that's left for this post are the loose ends.

## Music

## Image

In the process of writing these lookback posts I went through lots of photos of myself. Some were selfies, some were taken by other people, but either way the hit rate on me actually liking them (or just not disliking them!) is generally quite low. 

## Conclusion

Despite feeling like a year absent of any milestones or defining personal events, 2024 was full of things to look back on with fondness. There were adventures in the countryside, wargaming meetups with some of my best friends, parties, club nights[^1], gigs, great films, great books, and more besides. My career continued along its gentle upwards trajectory, with plenty of new things learned and insights gained. Relationships changed and deepened, new ones formed, and I worked hard on understanding myself better.

All in all, not a bad year.

Thanks for reading. I hope your 2024 was a good one and your 2025 is even better!
