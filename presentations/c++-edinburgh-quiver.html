# What is Quiver

Quiver is a game engine

It's like these:

<table width="100%" border="0%">
  <tr>
  <td><img src="/images/unreal.png" style="width: 90%"></td>
  <td><img src="/images/unity.png" style="width: 90%"></td>
  <td><img src="/images/game-maker.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

But WAY more scrappy! 
--
Also not ready. 
--
Also not as good.
--


Quiver has specific goals:

- Make making games with pseudo-3D graphics easy
- Have fun

---

## What is Pseudo-3D

Think *Wolfenstein 3D*, *Doom*.

<table width="100%" border="0%">
  <tr>
  <td><img src="/images/wolf3d.gif"></td>
  <td><img src="/images/doom.jpg" style="width:100%"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

# How it Works: Pseudo-3D Rendering

*Please imagine cool diagrams*

Raycasting like Wolfenstein 3D

- For each horizontal pixel, cast a ray

```cpp
// physicsWorld is a b2World
physicsWorld.RayCast(&callback, cameraPosition, rayEnd);
```

- From each fixture, extract render info

```cpp
const auto renderData = (FixtureRenderData*)intersection.m_fixture->GetUserData();
```

- Draw a line on the screen for the intersection 

```cpp
// Implementation details...
```

In its current iteration, this code makes judicious use of STL 

---

# How it Works: Entities

Baby's first Entity Component System

World owns Entity

Entity owns Components

Components interface with Systems

# So much to do

Scripting, better input handling, input recording and playback, more unit tests, benchmarks, more audio features, pathfinding, more animation features, support for local multiplayer, support for remote multiplayer (networking)...

It's a lot of work!

## How to Do It?

---

# Less like this...

.center[<img src="/images/girl-genius.jpg" style="width: 40%">]

---

#...more like this

.center[<img src="/images/makin-a-house.jpg" style="width: 90%">]

---

#...or this!
