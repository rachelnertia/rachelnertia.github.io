Free internet radio shows are wonderful things, aren't they? Here are some of my favourites, from history to economics to comedy.

## Hardcore History

Master storyteller [Dan Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Carlin) takes you along with him on deep dives into some of history's most fascinating periods, moments and ideas. What more could you want?

This podcast is released fairly irregularly, with gaps of several months between episodes, but the episodes are long and so, so good. Listening to one is like taking an extended soak in a wonderfully warm bath. You feel like a better human when you emerge.

## Planet Money

A bite-sized, ~20 minute episode of NPR's economics podcast is released about every 3 days. Sometimes it is a re-run of one from the archives, but these almost always have additional new stuff added to the end, such as brief check-ups on interviewees.

The show talks about money, what it is, what it does, where it comes from, where it goes. It's always educational, always fun and always worth a listen.

## Regular Features

This is a comedy podcast, the unsophisticated idiot kind in which a few guys make stupid, bawdy, immature jokes for roughly 40 minutes. Listening to it is almost always a highlight of my week.

## 99% Invisible

The design and architecture podcast with a seemingly limitless remit that brings me new knowledge every single week. Roman Mars - stop and think about that name for a moment - is at the helm with his warm and welcoming voice, but regularly hands off to reporters who investigate all kinds of interesting matters, from [sports bras](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-athletic-brassiere/) to [the origin of *Monopoly*](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-landlords-game/).
