Free internet radio shows are wonderful things, aren't they? Here are some of my favourites, ranging on subjects from history to economics to comedy.

## Hardcore History

In each episode, master storyteller [Dan Carlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Carlin) takes you on a deep dive into some of history's most fascinating periods, moments and ideas. What more could you want?

This podcast is released fairly irregularly, with gaps of several months between episodes, but it doesn't matter. The episodes, when they do arrive, are lengthy and immersive. Listening to one is like taking an extended soak in a wonderfully warm bath -- you feel like a better human when you emerge.

## Planet Money

A bite-sized, ~20 minute episode of NPR's economics podcast is released about every 3 days. Sometimes it is a re-run of one from the archives, but these almost always have additional new stuff added to the end, such as brief check-ups on interviewees.

The show talks about money, what it is, what it does, where it comes from, where it goes. It's always educational, always fun and always worth a listen.

## Regular Features

This is a comedy podcast, the unsophisticated idiot kind in which a few guys make stupid, bawdy, immature jokes for roughly 40 minutes. Listening to it is almost always a highlight of my week.

## 99% Invisible

The design and architecture podcast with a seemingly limitless remit. Each week brings new knowledge. Roman Mars - stop and think about that name for a moment - is at the helm with his warm and welcoming voice, but regularly hands off to reporters who investigate all kinds of interesting matters, from [sports bras](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-athletic-brassiere/) to [the origin of *Monopoly*](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-landlords-game/).

## Risky Business

If you want to hear grown men use the word "pwned" in normal conversation, look no further. This is a podcast about information technology security, with discussion of the week's news, interviews with industry professionals, and Australian accents. Worth listening to if you're a developer who's starting to think seriously about security, like me.

## CppCast

It's not like there are a lot of C++ podcasts. In fact, there's really only this one, so it's a good thing that it's excellent. Each week [Rob Irving](https://twitter.com/robwirving) and [Jason Turner](https://twitter.com/lefticus) bring a guest on to talk about recent C++ news and articles, and discuss their guest's experiences with C++.
