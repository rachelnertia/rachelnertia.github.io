Hiya! I'm Rachel Crawford, a videogame programmer and game design dabbler. This is my personal website, which I try to use to document my interests: programming, game dev, playing games in all their forms, books I'm reading, music I'm listening to, and painting tiny warriors. Please look around! 

From 2016-2025 I worked as a member of the Network Code team at Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, contributing to industry-leading titles including *Grand Theft Auto V Online*, *Red Dead Redemption II* and *Grand Theft Auto VI*. Prior to that I studied [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/) at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in bonny Dundee. 

I'm currently unemployed and looking for opportunities.

You can get my CV in PDF format [here](/files/Rachel%20Crawford%20CV.pdf).

You can follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nershly.bsky.social), where I am an intermittent poster.

I also have a (rather sparse) [itch.io page](http://inertia.itch.io/).

This site is representative of my ongoing struggle to learn web stuff, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rachelnertia/rachelnertia.github.io) if you wish.

Thanks for visiting.
