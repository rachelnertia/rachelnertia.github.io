Hiya! I'm a videogame programmer and game design dabbler. This is my personal website. Please look around! 

I currently work as a Senior Network Programmer at Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Previously I studied [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/) at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in bonny Dundee. 

I try to use this website to document my interests: programming, game dev, playing games in all their forms, books I'm reading, music I'm listening to, and painting tiny warriors.

You can follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/rachelnertia/), where I shitpost on the reg.

I also have a (rather sparse) [itch.io page](http://inertia.itch.io/).

This site is representative of my ongoing struggle to learn web stuff, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rachelnertia/rachelnertia.github.io) if you wish.

Thanks for visiting.
