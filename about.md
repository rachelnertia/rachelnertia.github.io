Hiya! I'm **Rachel Crawford**, a **videogame programmer** and **game design dabbler**. I currently dwell in **Edinburgh, Scotland**.

This is my personal website, which I (try to) use to document my interests: 

- programming 
- game dev 
- games in all their forms 
- books 
- music 
- walkin'
- cyclin'
- liftin'
- painting tiny people
 
Please look around! 

From **2016-2025** I worked as a **Network Programmer** (starting as a Junior and finishing as a Senior) on the **Network Code** team at [Rockstar North](https://www.rockstarnorth.com/), contributing to industry-leading titles including ***Grand Theft Auto V Online***, ***Red Dead Redemption II*** and the upcoming ***Grand Theft Auto VI***.

Prior to that, from **2012-2016**, I studied [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/) at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in bonny Dundee. 

**I'm currently unemployed and looking for opportunities**, mostly in games but elsewhere also, that make use of my skillset, which includes:

- C++ for game engine programming...
- C# for scripting, including C++/C# interop, and server programming...
- networking, from gameplay synchronisation to sessioning to online services integration
- Xbox, PlayStation, and Windows development...
- source control systems including Perforce and Git...
- Unity...
- other stuff I can't think of right now, or haven't learned yet but would be very excited to pick up!
