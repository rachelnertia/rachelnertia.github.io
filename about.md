Hiya! I'm a budding game developer with a focus on programming, and this is my personal website. Please look around! 

I studied [Computer Games Technology](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/courses//ug/comopgamestech/) at [Abertay University](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/) in bonny Dundee, Scotland. At the moment I'm in my first year of work in the triple-A games industry at Rockstar North in Edinburgh. It's going well!

I try to use this website to document projects I'm working on, write about things I'm learning, discuss games I'm playing, share music I'm listening to and other good stuff. I hope you get something useful out of your time here.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nershly) and I'm a semi-regular [Tumblr](http://nershly.tumblr.com/) user (when I make art, it tends to end up there).

I also have a (rather sparse) [itch.io page](http://inertia.itch.io/).

This site is representative of my ongoing struggle to learn web stuff, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/rachelnertia/rachelnertia.github.io) if you wish.

Thanks for visiting.
